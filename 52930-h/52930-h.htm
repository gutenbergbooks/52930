<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>Not the least difficult matter in connection
with the present work has been the choice
of a title. The one finally determined
upon is far from satisfactory, because it scarcely
suggests the scope of the subject treated. True
enough, the single word <span class="smcap">Nomenclature</span> offered
itself as a suitable title; but this is really a
French word, derived, of course, from the Latin, and
although it has been admitted into our vocabulary
simply owing to the lack of an English equivalent,
its use is properly restricted to the classification of
technical terms in relation to a particular branch
of science. In a scientific sense, then, the word
Nomenclature finds a ready acceptance; but for the
classification of the names of persons, of places, and
of things, it is altogether too pedantic. A young
friend of the author the other day, on being informed,
in answer to his inquiry, that this work
would probably be entitled “The Curiosities of
Nomenclature,” promptly asked whether it might
not be as well to explain, first of all, what the word
Nomenclature meant. Now, the author does not
believe for one moment that any intelligent person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
who took up this volume would be at a loss to judge
of its contents from the title, that is, supposing the
word Nomenclature appeared on the page; nevertheless,
his young friend’s suggestion reminded him
that a book intended not for the scientific and
learned, but for general reference, should bear a
title easily comprehended by all classes of the community.
The title originally chosen has, therefore,
been rejected in favour of one less pretentious and
more matter-of-fact: if it is not sufficiently expressive,
the fault must be attributed to the poverty of
the English language.</p>

<p>Of all the “Ologies,” <span class="smcap">Philology</span>, or the science of
language, is the most seductive; and that branch of
it known as <span class="smcap">Etymology</span>, which traces the derivation
and combination of the words of a language from
its primary roots, possesses an interest&mdash;one might
almost say a fascination&mdash;for all, when once the
attention has been arrested by it. This fact is
proved by the popularity of Archbishop Trench’s
published lectures on “The Study of Words,” which
have now reached a nineteenth edition. But it is
not to an examination of the dictionary words of the
English language that the present volume is devoted.
Bearing in mind that several excellent works already
exist on this subject, the author has occupied
himself in the following pages exclusively with the
etymology, and significance of <span class="smcap">Names</span>&mdash;of <i>personal
names</i>, comprising Surnames, Sobriquets, Pseudonyms,
Nicknames, Class Names, and Professional
Designations; of <i>names of places</i>, including the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Countries of the World, with the principal
Seas, Islands, Gulfs, Straits, &amp;c., the United
States of North America, the Counties of England
and Wales, and particularly the Districts, Streets,
Squares, Churches, and Public Buildings of London;
of the names of Religious Sects and Political Factions;
of the names of Inns and Taverns; in addition
to the names of an infinite number of objects with
which everyone is familiar, but whose actual significance
is comprehended only by a few.</p>

<p>As to the utility of such a work, a brief glance into
these pages may convince the reader that the subject
of <span class="smcap">Names</span> is fraught with much popular interest.
Take the names of London streets. How many
among the thousands who follow their daily occupations
within sight of the gilt cross of St. Paul’s,
ever reflect that the name of each street they frequent
and pass by the way, points to the origin of
the street itself; and that, were they to cultivate a
practical acquaintance with those names, their knowledge
of English History and Sociology might be
considerably enlarged, with a result that they would
be brought to ask themselves at length how they
could have been possessed of “souls so dead” as
never to have entered upon such a profitable field
of inquiry before? Whitefriars, Blackfriars, and
Austin Friars, carry us back in imagination to the
days of yore; the friars have long returned to the
dust, but the localities they inhabited are still identified
with their existence by the names they bear.
Yet these are possibly the only thoroughfares in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
City&mdash;with the exception of such as have derived
their names from a neighbouring church, public
building, or private mansion&mdash;concerning which the
average Londoner can express himself with any
degree of certainty: if he venture a guess at the
rest, it is safe to assert that he will be open to
correction. The like observation applies to public
buildings.</p>

<p>If the question were asked, for example, why
the well-known Ships’ Registry Offices over the
Royal Exchange are universally referred to as
“Lloyd’s,” ninety-nine out of every hundred City
men would avail themselves of the very plausible
suggestion that the system of Marine Insurance was
first established, either there or elsewhere, by some
person named Lloyd. True, a certain Edward Lloyd
had a remote connection with the enterprise; but he
was a coffee-house keeper, who probably knew no
more about ships and their tonnage than “Jonathan,”
another noted London coffee-house keeper,
after whom the Stock Exchange was formerly designated,
knew about “bulls” and “bears.” Again, it
is not every one who could account, off hand, for
such familiar names as Scotland Yard, Bedlam,
Doctors’ Commons, the Charterhouse, the churches
of St. Mary-Axe, St. Clement-Danes, St. Hallow’s-Barking,
or St. Catherine Cree. A few barristers
would, doubtless, be in a position to inform us
wherefore our seminaries for the study of the law
were originally styled “Inns of Court”; but the
ordinary inquirer, left to his own resources, might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
find the problem somewhat difficult to solve. Surely
they were not at one time inns? and if so, whence
came the designation Inns of Court? Did the Court
flunkeys patronize them, perhaps? Or, more likely,
did the sovereign, attended by the Court, take a fancy
to sleeping beneath the roof of each for once in a way,
after the manner of Queen Elizabeth? And, speaking
about inns, every Londoner is, of course, aware
of the one-time existence of “La Belle Sauvage” on
the north side of Ludgate Hill, albeit the origin of
this sign has generally been ascribed to Pocahontas,
of Virginia, who accompanied her husband, John
Rolfe, back to England in the year 1616, and, as
tradition has it, put up at this famous old coaching-house.
Moreover, Messrs. Cassell and Co., whose premises
occupy the site, and are approached from La
Belle Sauvage Yard, have profited by the popular
misconception to the extent of adopting the figure of
a female partly clad in skins as their trade-mark.
Then, again, who has not heard of “The Tabard”?
and whence did that derive its sign? Among other
celebrated inns still preserved to us, we have
“Jack Straw’s Castle” on Hampstead Heath. But
who was Jack Straw? and had he ever a castle
thereabouts? As will be shown in these pages, the
answer to these questions is associated with a very
stirring moment in English History.</p>

<p>A great deal of the early history of England can
be gleaned from the names of the counties into
which this country is divided. The terms Shire
and County are so far synonymous in that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
indicate a portion of land distinguished by a particular
name; yet, etymologically considered, they
are widely different. Although every shire is a
county, it is not every county to whose individual
name the word “shire” may be added. The latter is
essentially Anglo-Saxon, denoting a division of land
possessed by an earl, and wherever it occurs it points
conclusively to the Saxon occupation of England.
Certainly, we do not speak of Essex-shire, Middle-sex-shire,
or Sussex-shire, because the Saxon territories
referred to, as well as their relative positions,
are fully indicated in the names themselves. Neither
are we accustomed to allude to Surrey-shire, for the
reason that the word <i>Surrey</i> expressed the Anglo-Saxon
for the land south of the <i>rey</i>, or river,
comprising, as it did, that large tract of land described
as Wessex, or the land of the West Saxons,
now divided into six southern shires. The fact is,
Wessex was the great kingdom of the Saxons in this
country, whereas Essex, Middlesex, and Sussex were
but petty kingdoms. Consequently, in the kingdom
of Wessex it was that earldoms were first created,
and lands appertaining thereto were literally <i>scired</i>,
or sheared off. On the other hand, it would be
ridiculous in the extreme, quite apart from the
unfamiliarity of such an expression, to speak of
Kent-shire, because there is nothing in the name
that invests it with a Saxon interest. The same remark
is applicable to Cornwall. It is only from habit,
too, or because the name lends itself to the euphony,
that Devon is denominated a shire; for not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
is this a Celtic name, but the Saxons scarcely
penetrated into, and certainly never occupied any
considerable portion of, the county. The England
of the Saxons, therefore, is to be distinguished
wherever the word “shire” appears as part of the
name of a county.</p>

<p>If the foregoing paragraph be deemed interesting
to the general inquirer, a careful digest of the
chapter on “The Countries of the World” should
prove most instructive. With a few exceptions only,
the names of the different countries of the Old World
afford us an indication of their original inhabitants,
or the rude tribes that overran them. In regard to
the New World, such names of countries as are not
of native origin invariably point to the nationality
of the navigators who discovered them or of the
adventurers who explored and colonized them.
The maritime enterprise of the Spanish and Portuguese
is in nothing so evident as in the territories
named in accordance with their respective languages
in South and Central America, to say nothing of
the islands discovered by them in the Atlantic and
Pacific Oceans. And, as a set-off against the
shameful treatment by the Spaniards of Christopher
Columbus, it must not be forgotten that the whole
of the North American territory now embraced in the
United States was originally designated Columbia in
his honour, which name has been preserved in the
Western portion of the continent known as British
Columbia. A few Spanish names still linger
in North America, notably California, Labrador,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Florida, Nevada, Oregon, and Colorado. But the
Spaniards were rovers rather than settlers; wherefore
they contented themselves with maintaining
their national reputation as successful navigators by
giving names to the countries they discovered, and
establishing a lucrative trading monopoly in that
portion of the Caribbean Sea which formerly bore
the name of the Spanish Main.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the English and French have
distinguished themselves always, and all the world
over, as colonists; so that, saving those States of
North America which have received the native
names of the great lakes and rivers, we can discover
exactly which were colonized by the one nation and
which by the other. Moreover, the English and
French have generally exercised the common trait of
honouring the mother country by naming a new
colony or a newly-discovered island after the
reigning monarch or a distinguished countryman.
A similar trait in the Dutch character presents
itself in the repetition of the names of the native
places of their navigators and colonists; while the
Spaniards and Portuguese have displayed a tendency
for naming an island discovered or a river explored
by them in a manner commemorative of the day
that witnessed the event. At the same time, it
would not be wise to conjecture, merely from the
name, that Columbus discovered the island of
Trinidad on the Feast of the Holy Trinity, because
he did nothing of the kind. Therefore, it behoves the
curious inquirer to make himself acquainted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the circumstances under which our geographical
names have arisen, so as to avoid falling into error.
As well might he maintain, without the requisite
knowledge, that the Canary Islands owed their
designation to the birds that have so long been
exported thence; for although such a conclusion were
extremely plausible, he would still be at a loss to
know how the canaries came by their name in the
first place.</p>

<p>A like difficulty is liable to be encountered relative
to the Sandwich Islands. A particularly smart boy
might, indeed, be expected to inform us, as the
outcome of a hastily-formed opinion, that the Sandwich
Islands were so called because a shipwrecked
crew who once found a refuge thereon continued to
support themselves until such time as they were
rescued by a passing vessel upon sandwiches. The
bare idea may be laughed at; but it is no more
preposterous than that the Canary Islands received
their name from the birds that are found there in
such plenty. The question at issue furnishes an
example as to how a name may be perpetuated in
different ways. Thus, Captain Cook named the
Sandwich Islands in compliment to John Montague,
fourth Earl of Sandwich and First Lord of the
Admiralty, who took his title from Sandwich, or, as
the etymology of this place implies, the “sand
town,” one of the ancient Cinque Ports in Kent.
An inveterate gamester was this Lord Sandwich; so
much so that he would sit at the gaming-table for
thirty hours and more at a stretch, never desisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
from the game to partake of a meal, but from time
to time ordering the waiter to bring him some slices
of meat placed between two slices of thin bread,
from which circumstance this convenient form of
refreshment received the name of Sandwiches.</p>

<p>Mention of sandwiches reminds us that very few
tradesmen possess the remotest idea of the significance
of the names of the various commodities in
which they deal. Ask a purveyor of ham and beef
to explain the origin of the word Sandwich, and he
will be quite unable to furnish an answer. Put a
similar question to a Tobacconist, and it will be
found that he has never interested himself to the
extent of inquiring what the word Tobacco means, not
to speak of the names of the different kinds of tobacco.
A Haberdasher, again, would be sorely
perplexed to account for his individual trade-name;
so would a Milliner, so would a Grocer, so would a
Tailor; and so would almost every one who passes
for an intelligent citizen, yet whose reflections have
never been directed toward those trifling concerns
which, as one might be led to suppose, are most
immediately interesting to him. And so we might
go on multiplying examples until this Introduction
reached an altogether inordinate length, with no
other object than to arouse the reader’s interest in
the pages that follow. But the necessity for a more
extended Introduction does not arise. The scope
of this work will be sufficiently indicated by the
Analytical Table of Contents; but even there a very
large number of names incidentally referred to in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the text have not been included. The Index may be
somewhat more to the purpose, inasmuch as every
item set forth therein will be found not merely
alluded to but discussed in the book; and to the
book itself the reader is now referred.</p>

<h2 id="THE_COUNTRIES_OF_THE_WORLD"><i>THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD.</i></h2>

<p>The oldest of the four great divisions of the
world received its modern designation <b>Asia</b>
from the Sanskrit <i>Ushas</i>, signifying “land
of the dawn.” <b>Africa</b> traces its origin to the
Phœnician <i>afer</i>, a black man, and the Sanskrit <i>ac</i>, the
earth, a country. <b>Europe</b> owes its name to the
Greek <i>eurus</i>, broad, and <i>op</i>, to see, or <i>ops</i>, the face, in
allusion to “the broad face of the earth.” <b>America</b>
honours the memory of Amerigo Vespucci, the
Florentine navigator, who landed on the New Continent
south of the Equator, the year after Columbus
discovered the northern mainland in 1498. The
name of America first appeared in a work published
by Waldsemüller at St. Die, in Lorraine, in the year
1507. It is worthy of note that when Columbus
landed in America he imagined he had set foot on
part of that vast territory east of the Ganges
vaguely known as India; therefore he gave the
name of <b>Indians</b> to the aborigines. This also
accounts for the islands in the Caribbean Sea
being styled the <b>West Indies</b>.</p>

<p>The cradle of the human race bears the name of
<b>Palestine</b>, or in Hebrew <i>Palestina</i>, meaning “the
land of strangers,” agreeably to the native word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
<i>palash</i>, to wander. Palestine is usually denominated
the <b>Holy Land</b>, because it was the scene of the
birth, life, and death of the Redeemer. <b>Asia
Minor</b> is, of course, Lesser Asia.</p>

<p>For the title of <b>Persia</b> we are indebted to the
Greeks, who gave the name of <i>Persis</i> to the region
(of which the capital was <i>Persipolis</i>) originally overrun
by a wild branch of the Ayrian race called the
Parsa, meaning, in the native tongue, “the Tigers”
[<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_64"><span class="smcap">Parsees</span></a>]. The suffix <i>ia</i>, wherever it occurs in
a geographical sense, expresses the Celtic for land
or territory. Hence, Persia signifies the territory of
the Parsa or Parsees; <b>Arabia</b>, the country of the
Arabs, “men of the desert”; <b>Abyssinia</b>, that of the
Abassins, or “mixed races”; <b>Kaffraria</b>, that of the
Kaffirs, or “unbelievers”; and <b>Ethiopia</b>, the “land
of the blacks,” according to the two Greek words
<i>aithein</i>, to burn, and <i>ops</i>, the face. <b>India</b> denotes
the country traversed by the <b>Indus</b>, or rather the
<i>Hindu</i>, which name is a Persicized form of the
Sanskrit <i>Sindhu</i>, “a great river,” rendered <i>Hindus</i> in
the Greek. Synonymous with the Celtic suffix just
discussed is the Persian <i>stan</i>: consequently <b>Hindustan</b>
signifies the territory traversed by the river
<i>Hindu</i>, and peopled by the Hindoos; <b>Turkestan</b>,
the country of the Turks; <b>Afghanistan</b>, that of
the Afghans; <b>Beloochistan</b>, that of the Belooches;
and <b>Kurdestan</b>, properly <b>Koordistan</b>, that of the
Koords. The term <b>China</b> is a western corruption
of Tsina, so called in honour of Tsin, the founder
of the great dynasty which commenced in the third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
century <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, when a knowledge of this country was
first conveyed to the Western nations. It was this
Tsin who built the Great Wall of China (or Tsin) to
keep out the Barbarians. The Chinese Empire bears
the description of the <b>Celestial Empire</b> because its
early rulers were all celestial deities. <b>Siberia</b> is a
term indicative of <i>Siber</i>, the residence of Kutsheen
Khan, the celebrated Tartar prince, recognized as
the ancient capital of the Tartars, the ruins of
which may still be seen. Here again the Celtic
suffix <i>ia</i> has reference to the surrounding territory.</p>

<p><b>Russia</b> constituted the country of the Russ, a
tribe who overran it at a very early period. The
Russian Empire was founded by Ruric, or Rourik, a
Scandinavian chief whose death took place in the
year <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, 879. <b>Circassia</b> denotes the country of the
Tcherkes, a Tartar tribe who settled in the neighbourhood
of the river Terck. The <b>Crimea</b> received
its name from a small town established in the peninsula
by the Kimri, or Cymri, and known to the Greeks
as <i>Kimmerikon</i>. <b>Finland</b> is properly Fenland, “the
land of marshes.” <b>Sweden</b> is a modern term made
up of the Latin <i>Suedia</i>, signifying the land of the
Suevi, a warlike tribe of the Goths, and the Anglo-Saxon
<i>den</i>, testifying to its occupation by the Danes.
Norway shows the result of a gradual modification
of the Anglo-Saxon <i>Norea</i>, and the original <i>Nordoe</i>,
being the Scandinavian for “north island.” It is
easy to understand in this connection how the old
Norsemen, deterred by the intense cold of the Arctic
Sea, took it for granted that the great northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
peninsula was surrounded by water, without actually
determining the fact. The native name of this
country in modern times is <i>Nordrike</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the north
kingdom.</p>

<p><b>Britain</b> was known to the Phœnicians as <i>Barat-Anac</i>,
or “the land of tin,” as far back as the year
1037 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> Some five hundred years afterwards the
Island was alluded to by the Romans under the
name of Britannia, which subsequently became
shortened into Britain. <b>England</b> was originally
<i>Engaland</i>, the land of the Engles, or Angles, who
came over from Sleswick, a province of Jutland.
Prior to the year 258, which witnessed its invasion
by the Scoti, a tribe who inhabited the northern
portions of the country now known as Ireland,
<b>Scotland</b> bore the name of <b>Caledonia</b>, literally the
hilly country of the Caels, or Gaels. The word Cael,
or Gael, is a corruption of <i>Gadhel</i>, signifying in the
native tongue “a hidden rover”; while Scot, derived
from the native <i>scuite</i>, means practically the same
thing, <i>i.e.</i>, a wanderer. The Caledonians were the
inhabitants of the Highlands, the termination <i>dun</i>
expressing the Celtic for a hill, fort, stronghold; the
Scots were the invaders from <b>Scotia</b>, who appropriated
the Hebrides and the Western Islands;
whereas the Lowlanders were the Picts, so called
from their description by the Romans, <i>picti</i>, painted
men. These Picts were eventually subdued by the
Caledonians and Britons from their respective sides.
The Gaelic designation of what is now <b>Ireland</b> was
<i>Ierne</i>, indicative of the “western isle.” Ireland is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
commonly styled <b>The Emerald Isle</b> owing to its
fresh verdure.</p>

<p>Wales was originally <b>Cambria</b>, so called on account
of the Cymri, or Kimri, who peopled it. The
modern title of <b>Wales</b> was given to this province
by the Anglo-Saxons, because they regarded it, in
common with Cornwall, as the land of foreigners.
Traces of the Wahl or Welsh still present themselves
in such names as Wallachia, Walcheren,
Walloon, Wallingford, Welshpool, &amp;c. Thus we see
that the prenomen <i>Wahl</i>, subject to slight modifications
in the spelling, denotes any foreign settlement
from the Saxon point of view. The Saxons,
by the way, whose original settlement is determined
by the little kingdom of <b>Saxony</b>, derived their name
from the <i>seax</i>, or short crooked knife with which they
armed themselves.</p>

<p>France was known to the Greeks as <i>Gallatia</i>, and
to the Romans as <i>Gallia</i>, afterwards modified into
<b>Gaul</b>, because it was the territory of the Celtiæ, or
Celts. The modern settlers of the country were the
Franks, so called from the <i>franca</i>, a kind of javelin
which they carried, who in the fifth century inhabited
the German province of <b>Franconia</b>, and,
travelling westwards, gradually accomplished the
conquest of Gaul. <b>France</b>, therefore, signifies the
country of the Franks, or, as the Germans call it,
<i>Frankreich</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the Kingdom of the Franks. All
the western nations were styled Franks by the
Turks and Orientals, and anything brought to them
from the west invariably merited a prenomen descriptive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of its origin, as, for example, <span class="smcapuc">FRANKINCENSE</span>,
by which was meant incense brought from the
country of the Franks. <b>Normandy</b> indicates the
coast settlement of the Northmen, or Danes; while
<b>Brittany</b> comprised the land appropriated by the
kings of Britain.</p>

<p><b>Germany</b> was in ancient times known as Tronges,
or the country of the Tungri, a Latin word signifying
“speakers”; but the Romans afterwards gave
it the name of Germanus, which was a Latinized
Celtic term meaning “neighbours,” originally
bestowed by the Gauls upon the warlike people
beyond the Rhine. <b>Holland</b> is the modern acceptation
of <i>Ollant</i>, the Danish for “marshy ground”;
whereas <b>Belgium</b> denotes the land of the Belgiæ.
The fact that the term <b>Netherlands</b> is expressive of
the low countries need scarcely detain us. <b>Denmark</b>
is properly Danmark, <i>i.e.</i>, the territory comprised
within the <i>marc</i>, or boundary established by Dan, the
Scandinavian chieftain. <b>Jutland</b> means the land
of the Jutes, a family of the Goths who settled in
this portion of Denmark. <b>Prussia</b> is a corruption
of <i>Borussia</i>, the country of the Borussi; and
<b>Bohemia</b>, the country of the Boii, just as <b>Hungary</b>
was originally inhabited by the Huns, a warlike
Asiatic family, who expelled the Goths from this
territory in the year 376. These Huns were first
heard of in China in the third century <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> under the
name of <i>Hiong-nu</i>, meaning “giants.” <b>Poland</b>
is an inversion of <i>Land-Pole</i>, the Slavonic for “men
of the plains,” who first overran this territory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Servia</b> was styled by the Romans <i>Suedia</i>, the
district peopled by the Suevi before they were driven
northwards to their final settlement in the territory
now called Sweden. <b>Montenegro</b> literally indicates
“black mountain.” <b>Bosnia</b> is the country traversed
by the river Bosna; <b>Moldavia</b>, that traversed by
the Moldau; and <b>Moravia</b>, that traversed by the
Morava. <b>Bulgaria</b> is a modern corruption of <i>Volgaria</i>,
meaning the country peopled by the Volsci;
while <b>Roumania</b> was anciently a Roman province.
<b>Turkey</b> is more correctly written <i>Turkia</i>, the country
of the Turks. This country also bears the style of
the <b>Ottoman Empire</b>, in honour of Othman I.,
who assumed the government of the empire about
the year 1300. <b>Greece</b> is the modern form of the
Latin <i>Græcia</i>, from the Greek <i>Graikoi</i>, a name
originally bestowed upon the inhabitants of Hellas.</p>

<p><b>Austria</b> is our mode of describing the <i>Oesterreich</i>,
literally the Eastern Empire, in contradistinction
to the Western Empire founded by Charlemagne.
<b>Italy</b> was so called after Italus, one of the early
kings of that country. <b>Switzerland</b> is an Anglicized
form of the native Schweitz, the name of the three
forest cantons whose people asserted their independence
of Austria, afterwards applied to the whole
country. <b>Spain</b> expresses the English of <i>Hispania</i>, a
designation founded upon the Punic <i>span</i>, a rabbit,
owing to the number of wild rabbits found in this
peninsula by the Carthaginians. The ancient name
of the country was <i>Iberia</i>, so styled from the Iberi,
a tribe who settled in the vicinity of the river Ebro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
<b>Portugal</b> was the <i>Portus Cale</i>, literally “the port
Cale” of the Romans, the ancient name of the city
of Oporto.</p>

<p><b>Algiers</b> is a modified spelling of the Arabic
<i>Al Jezair</i>, meaning “the peninsula.” <b>Tunis</b> was
anciently known as Tunentum, the land of the
Tunes; <b>Morocco</b> signifies the territory of the
Moors; and <b>Barbary</b> that of the Berbers. The
term <b>Sahara</b> is Arabic for “desert”; while the
<b>Soudan</b> denotes, according to the Arabic <i>Belad-ez-Suden</i>,
the “district of the blacks.” <b>Egypt</b> expresses
the Hebrew for “the land of oppression,”
alluding to the bondage of the Israelites. <b>Senegambia</b>
was originally so named owing to its
situation between the Senegal and Gambia rivers.
The <b>Gold Coast</b> is that portion of Guinea on the
West Coast of Africa where gold is found. <b>Guinea</b>
is a native West African term meaning “abounding
in gold.” In <b>Zanzibar</b>, properly written <i>Zanguebar</i>,
we have an inversion of the Arabic <i>Ber-ez-Zing</i>, the
“coast of the negroes.” <b>Zululand</b> is the country
of the Zulus. By the <b>Transvaal</b> is meant the
territory beyond the river Vaal; just as in Europe
the Hungarians call a portion of their country
<span class="smcap">Transylvania</span>, from its situation “beyond the
wood.” <b>Natal</b> received its name from Vasco di
Gama because he discovered it on the Feast of the
Nativity. The settlements of the Dutch Boers in
South Africa are designated the <b>Orange Free
States</b> from the circumstance that their original
settlers were emigrants from the Principality of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Orange, in Holland. <b>Cape Colony</b> is the British
colony in South Africa, so called after the Dutch
settlement at Cape Town, which dates from the year
1652. The <b>Cape of Good Hope</b>, discovered by
Bartholomew de Diaz in 1487, was so named (<i>Cabo
de Bon Esperance</i>) by John II., King of Portugal,
who, finding that Diaz had reached the extremity of
Africa, regarded it as a favourable augury for future
maritime enterprises.</p>

<p>The most southern point of South America was
called Cape Hoorn (or, according to the English,
<b>Cape Horn</b>) by Schonten, who first rounded it in
1616, after Hoorn, his native place in North Holland.
<b>Patagonia</b> was so styled by Magellan in accordance
with the Spanish word <i>patagon</i>, meaning a large,
clumsy foot. It was from the fact of seeing the
impressions of the large shoes (not, as he imagined,
the feet) of the aborigines that he at once concluded
the country must be inhabited by giants. <b>Chili</b>
is a Peruvian word denoting the “land of snow.”
<b>Argentina</b>, now the <b>Argentine Republic</b>, owes
its name to the silvery reflection of its rivers.
<b>Brazil</b> is a Portuguese term derived from <i>braza</i>, “a
live coal,” relative to the red dye-wood with which
the country abounds. <b>Bolivia</b> perpetuates the
memory of General Simon Bolivar, “the Liberator
of Peru.” <b>Uraguay</b> and <b>Paraguay</b> are both names
of rivers; the former meaning “the golden water,”
and the latter “the river of waters,” referring to its
numerous tributaries. <b>Peru</b> likewise received its
name from its principal river, the Rio Paro, upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
which stands the ancient city of Paruru. The Brazilian
term <i>Para</i>, however modified, is at all times
suggestive of a river. <b>Pernambuco</b> means “the
mouth of hell,” in allusion to the violent surf
always distinguished at the mouth of its chief river.
<b>Ecuador</b> is Spanish for Equator, so called by virtue
of its geographical position. <b>Columbia</b> was named
in honour of Christopher Columbus. <b>Venezuela</b>
expresses the Spanish for “Little Venice,” which
designation was given to this country owing to the
discovery of some Indian villages built upon piles
after the manner of the “Silent City” on the Adriatic
Sea.</p>

<p>The term <b>Panama</b> is Caribbean, indicative of the
mud fish that abound in the waters on both sides of
the isthmus. <b>Costa Rica</b> is literal Spanish for
“rich coast”; while <b>Honduras</b> signifies, in the same
tongue, “deep water.” The name of <b>Nicaragua</b>
was first given by Gil Gonzales de Arila in 1521 to
the great lake situated in the region now called
after it, in consequence of his friendly reception
by the <i>Cacique</i>, a Haytian term for a chief, whose
own name was Nicaro, of a tribe of West Indians,
with whom he fell in on the borders of the lake
referred to. The <b>Mosquito Coast</b> owes its name to
the troublesome insects (Spanish <i>mosca</i>, from the
Latin <i>musca</i>, a fly) which infest this neighbourhood.
<b>Yutacan</b> is a compound Indian word meaning
“What do you say?” which was the only answer
the Spaniards could obtain from the natives to their
inquiries concerning a description of the country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
<b>Quatemala</b> is a European rendering of the Mexican
<i>quahtemali</i>, signifying “a decayed log of wood”; so
called by the Mexican Indians who accompanied
Alvarado into this region, because they found an old
worm-eaten tree near the ancient palace of the
Kings, or <i>Kachiquel</i>, which was thought to be the
centre of the country.</p>

<p><b>Mexico</b> denotes the place or seat of Mexitli, the
Aztec God of War. The name of <b>California</b>,
derived from the two Spanish words, <i>Caliente Fornalla</i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, “hot furnace,” was given by Cortez in
the year 1535 to the peninsula now known as Old or
Lower California, of which he was the discoverer, on
account of its hot climate. <b>British Columbia</b> is
the only portion of North America that retains the
name of the discoverer of the New World; but
originally the whole of the territory now comprised
in the United States bore the designation of <b>Columbia</b>
in honour of Christopher Columbus. The
term <b>Canada</b> is Indian, indicative of a “collection
of huts”; <b>Manitoba</b> traces its origin from Manitou,
the Indian appellation of “The Great Spirit.”
<b>Ontario</b> comes from the native <i>Onontac</i>, “the
village on the mountain,” and chief seat of the
Onondagas; while <b>Quebec</b> is an Algonquin term
signifying “take care of the rock.” <b>Labrador</b> was
originally denominated <i>Tierra Labrador</i>, the Spanish
for “cultivated land,” as distinguished from the
non-fertile though moss-covered <b>Greenland</b>. <b>New
Brunswick</b>, colonized in 1785, received its name in
compliment to the House of Brunswick. <b>Nova<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Scotia</b>, otherwise New Scotland, was so called by
Sir William Alexander, a Scotsman who obtained a
grant of this colony from James I. in 1621. <b>Florida</b>
was named by Ponce de Leon in accordance with
the day of its discovery, to wit, Easter Sunday,
which in the Spanish language is styled <i>Pascua
Florida</i>.</p>

<p>The first British settlement in North America was
claimed by Sir Walter Raleigh on the 13th of July,
1584, in the name of Queen Elizabeth, and called
<b>Virginia</b> in her honour. <b>Maryland</b> was so denominated
by Lord Baltimore (who gave the name
of <b>Baltimore</b> to a neighbouring State), in honour of
Henrietta Maria, Queen of Charles I. <b>Pennsylvania</b>
denotes the colony founded “in the wood” by William
Penn, the son of Admiral Penn, in 1681. This is
usually alluded to as the <span class="smcap">Keystone State</span>, from its
relative position to the other States. <b>Georgia</b> was
named after George II., in whose reign this state
was colonized; and <b>Carolina</b> (North and South)
after Carolus II., the Latinized style of Charles II.,
by whom this state was granted to eight of his
favourites. <b>Louisiana</b> was so called by M. de la
Sale in the year 1682, in honour of Louis XIV. of
France; while <b>Maine</b> and <b>New Orleans</b> received
the names of existing French provinces. The title
of <b>New Hampshire</b> was given to the state granted
to him in 1629 by John Mason, in compliment to his
native county in England; <b>New Jersey</b> complimented
the scene of action whereon Sir George
Carterat distinguished himself in the defence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Jersey Island against the Parliamentary forces in
1664; and <b>New York</b> (State) was denominated in
honour of James, Duke of York, afterwards James
II. [For <b>Michigan</b> see the great lake of the same
name.] <b>Indiana</b> derived its name from the great
number of Indians found here. <b>Alabama</b> in the
native tongue, signifies “Here we rest”; <b>Nebraska</b>
means “water valley”; <b>Ohio</b> is “beautiful”;
<b>Massachusetts</b>, “about the great hills”; <b>Wisconsin</b>,
“wild rushing channel”; <b>Kansas</b>, “smoky
water”; <b>Tennessee</b>, “river of the great bend”;
<b>Kentucky</b>, “at the head of a river”; <b>Mississippi</b>,
“great and long river”; <b>Missouri</b>, “muddy river”;
and <b>Minnesota</b>, “white water.” <b>Arkansas</b> conveys
the same meaning as Kansas, with the addition of the
French prefix <i>arc</i>, a bow. <b>Illinois</b> is a compound of
the Indian <i>illum</i>, men, and the French suffix <i>oix</i>, a
tribe. <b>Oregon</b> received its name from the Spanish
<i>oregano</i>, wild majoram, which grows in abundance
on this portion of the Pacific shore. <b>Texas</b> means
“the place of protection,” in reference to the fact
that a colony of French refugees were afforded
protection here by General Lallemont in 1817;
<b>Vermont</b> is, more correctly, <i>Verd Mont</i>, so called
in testimony to the verdure-clad mountains which
traverse this state; <b>Colorado</b> expresses the Spanish
for “coloured,” alluding to its coloured ranges;
while <b>Nevada</b> is Spanish for “snowy,” indicative
of the character of its mountain ridges, the
<i>Sierra Nevada</i>. <b>Connecticut</b> presents itself in
the native Indian form <i>Quinnitukut</i>, meaning “the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
country of the long river”; <b>Iowa</b> is a French
corruption of a Sioux term, signifying “drowsy,” or
“the sleepy ones,” applied to the Pahoja, or Gray-snow
tribe; <b>Astoria</b> was founded by John Jacob
Astor, of New York, as a fur-trading station in the
year 1811; and <b>Delaware</b> received its name from
Thomas West, Lord de La Warre, Governor of
Virginia, who visited the bay in 1610, and died on
board his vessel at its mouth.</p>

<p><b>Lake Superior</b> denotes the uppermost and chief
of the five great lakes of North America. <b>Lake
Erie</b> is the Lake of the “Wild Cat,” the name given
to a fierce tribe of Indians exterminated by the
Iroquois. <b>Lake Huron</b> owes its name to the
French word <i>hure</i>, a head of hair; in reference to
the Wyandots, whom the French settlers designated
Hurons owing to their profusion of hair. <b>Lake
Ontario</b> bears the denomination of the Canadian
territory already discussed. <b>Niagara</b>, or rather, to
give it its full name, <i>Oni-aw-garah</i>, expresses the
West Indian for “the thunder of waters.” <b>Lake
Michigan</b> signifies in the native tongue “a weir for
fish”; and <b>Lake Winnipeg</b>, “lake of the turbid
water.” The <b>Great Bear Lake</b> is indebted for its
name to its northern situation [<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_49"><span class="smcap">Arctic Ocean</span></a>];
and the <b>Great Salt Lake</b>, to the saline character
of its waters.</p>

<p>Having disposed of the different countries, let us
now consider the nomenclature of the principal seas
and islands.</p>

<p>The <b>Arctic Ocean</b> received its name pursuant to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the Greek <i>arktos</i>, a bear, on account of the northern
constellations of the Great and Little Bear. The
<b>Antarctic Ocean</b> denotes the ocean <i>anti</i>, against,
or opposite to, the Arctic Ocean. The <b>Atlantic
Ocean</b>, known to the Greeks by the name of <i>Atlantikos
pelagos</i>, was originally so called from the Isle of
Atlantes, which both Plato and Homer imagined to
be situated beyond the Straits of Gibraltar. The
<b>Pacific Ocean</b> was so named by Magellan, owing to
its calm and pacific character, in striking contrast to
his tempestuous passage through the Straits of Magellan,
from which he emerged November 27, 1520. The
<b>Caribbean Sea</b> washes the territory of the Caribbs,
whose name means “cruel men.” The <b>Mediterranean
Sea</b> expresses the Latin (<i>medius</i>, middle,
and <i>terra</i>, earth) for the sea between two continents,
viz., Europe and Africa. The <b>Adriatic Sea</b> indicates
the Sea of Adrian or Hadrian. The <b>Baltic Sea</b>
denotes, in accordance with the Swedish <i>bält</i>, a strait,
a sea full of belts, or straits. The <b>North Sea</b>, the
<b>German Ocean</b>, the <b>Indian Ocean</b>, and the <b>Irish
Sea</b>, are names indicative of the positions of these
respective seas. The <b>White Sea</b> is so called from
its proximity to sterile regions of snow and ice; the
<b>Black Sea</b>, because it abounds with black rocks;
the <b>Red Sea</b>, on account of the red soil which
forms its bottom; the <b>Green Sea</b>, owing to a
strip of green always discernible along the Arabian
shore; the <b>Yellow Sea</b>, from the immense quantity
of alluvial soil continually poured into it
by the Yang-tse-Kiang river; and the <b>Dead Sea</b>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
because no fish of any kind has ever been found in
its waters. The <b>Caspian Sea</b> preserves the name of
the Caspii, a tribe who originally formed a settlement
on its shores. The <b>Sea of Marmora</b> owes its designation
to a small island at its western extremity which
has long been famous for its marble (Latin <i>marmor</i>)
quarries. The <b>Gulf Stream</b> is a warm current of
water that issues from the mouth of the Amazon,
immediately under the Equator, and after traversing
the coast of South America, the Caribbean Sea, the
Gulf of Mexico, and the coast of the United States,
makes its way across the Atlantic directly for the
British Isles, raising the temperature of the water
through which it passes. The <b>Horse Latitudes</b>,
situated between the trade winds and the westerly
winds of higher latitudes, and distinguished for
tedious calms, received this name because it was in
this portion of the Atlantic the old navigators often
threw overboard the horses which they had undertaken
to transport to the West Indies. The southern
banks of the West India Islands, and the water extending
for some distance into the Caribbean Sea,
were formerly known as the <b>Spanish Main</b>, from
the fact that the Spaniards confined their buccaneering
enterprises to this locality.</p>

<p><b>Hudson’s Bay</b> and <b>Hudson’s Strait</b> were named
after their re-discovery by Captain Henry Hudson while
searching for the north-west passage in 1610. Prior
to this date the Bay and the Strait had not been
navigated since their original discovery by Cabot in
1512. <b>James’ Bay</b> honours the memory of James<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
I., in whose reign it was completely explored. Quite
a number of straits, gulfs, and bays bear the names
of their respective navigators; therefore these need
not detain us here. An exception exists in the case
of <b>Barrow’s Strait</b>, which was so called by Captain
Penny in compliment to John Barrow, the son of
Sir John Barrow the traveller and statesman, in
1850. <b>All Saints’ Bay</b> was discovered by Vespucci
on the Feast of All Saints in the year 1503. The
<b>Gulf of St. Lawrence</b> was first explored, and the
navigation of the long river of the same name commenced,
on the Feast of St. Lawrence, 1500. The
<b>Gulf of Carpentaria</b> preserves the memory of a
Dutch captain named Carpenter who discovered it
in 1606. <b>Torres Strait</b> received the name of the
Spanish navigator, L. V. de Torres, to whom its discovery
was due, in the year 1606. <b>Botany Bay</b> was
so called by Captain Cook from the great variety of
plants which he found growing on its shores when
exploring it in the year 1770. The <b>St. George’s
Channel</b> was named after the patron saint of England.
The <b>Skagerrack</b> denotes the “crooked
strait between the Skagen” (so called from the Gothic
<i>skaga</i>, a promontory), which forms the northern extremity
of Jutland and Norway. <b>Zuyder Zee</b>
expresses the Dutch for the “south sea,” in relation
to the North Sea or German Ocean. The <b>Bay of
Biscay</b> takes its name from the Basque or Basquan,
<i>i.e.</i>, mountainous provinces, whose shores are
washed by its waters. The <b>Strait of Gibraltar</b>
honours the reputation of Ben Zeyad Tarik, a Moorish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
general who effected the invasion of Spain in the
year 712 by obtaining possession of the apparently
impregnable rock which has ever since borne the
name, in consequence, of <i>Jebel al tarik</i>, the Mountain
of Tarik. The <b>Bosphorus</b> is a Greek term composed
of <i>bous</i>, an ox, and <i>porus</i>, a ford, alluding to the
legend that when Io was transformed into a cow
she forded this strait. The <b>Dardanelles</b> derive
their name from the ancient city of Dardanus,
founded by Dardanus, the ancestor of Priam, where
the castle now stands on the Asiatic side.</p>

<p>By the term <b>Australia</b> is meant “the South,”
and by <b>Australasia</b> “Southern Asia,” agreeably to
the Latin <i>australis</i>, southern. Previous to its settlement
by the British, Australia was known as <b>New
Holland</b> owing to its discovery by the Dutch in the
year 1606. The existing name of <b>New Zealand</b>
likewise bears testimony to the deep-rooted affection
of the Dutch navigators, and indeed of the Dutch
people generally, for their native country&mdash;the word
<i>Zeeland</i>, denoting sea-land, being significant of the
low countries. <b>Tasmania</b> was originally known as
<b>Van Dieman’s Land</b>, the name bestowed upon it
by Abel Jansen Tasman, who discovered it in 1642,
in compliment to the daughter of the Dutch governor
of Batavia. The change of title was effected in 1853.
<b>The Society Islands</b> received their name from
Captain Cook in honour of the Royal Society; the
<b>Friendly Islands</b>, on account of the friendly disposition
of the natives; and <b>Christmas Island</b>,
because he set foot upon it on Christmas Day, 1777.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
The naming of the <b>Sandwich Islands</b> by Cook
conveyed a graceful compliment to Lord Sandwich,
First Lord of the Admiralty. The <b>Philippine
Islands</b>, discovered by Magellan in 1521, were
named after Philip II. of Spain; and the <b>Caroline
Islands</b> discovered by Lopez de Villalobos in 1543,
after Charles V., Emperor of Germany and first King
of Spain.</p>

<p><b>Papua</b> is a Portuguese term for “frizzled,” in
allusion to the enormous frizzled heads of hair worn
by the natives; <b>Java</b> is a native Malay word signifying
“the land of nutmegs;” <b>Sumatra</b>, a corruption
of <i>Trimatara</i>, means “the happy land”; while
<b>Borneo</b> comes from the Sanskrit <i>bhurni</i>, “land.”
<b>Japan</b> is a European modification, brought about
through the Portuguese <i>Gepuen</i>, of the native <i>Niphon</i>,
compounded of <i>ni</i>, sun, fire, and <i>pon</i>, land, literally
sun-land, or “land of the rising sun,” and signifying
“the fountain of light.” <b>Formosa</b> is Portuguese
for “beautiful”; whereas <b>Ceylon</b>, rendered in the
Portuguese tongue <i>Selen</i>, is but part of the original
Sanskrit <i>Sinhala-dwipa</i>, “the Island of Lions.” The
<b>Mauritius</b>, when colonized by the Dutch, received
the name of Maurice, Prince of Orange; and the
<b>Isle of Bourbon</b>, when settled by the French, that
of the Bourbon family. <b>Madagascar</b> is properly
<i>Malagasy</i>, the Island of the Malagese, because the
natives belong to the Malay race.</p>

<p><b>Tierra del Fuego</b> expresses the Spanish for “land
of fire.” The <b>Island of Desolation</b> was so designated
by Captain Cook owing to the absence of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
signs of life. <b>Hanover Island</b> honours the House
of Hanover; and <b>Adelaide Island</b>, the queen of
William IV.; while <b>Juan Fernandez</b> (also known
as <b>Selkirk’s Island</b>, after Alexander Selkirk, its
solitary inhabitant from September, 1704, to February,
1707), perpetuates the name of its discoverer
in the year 1567. The <b>Ladrone Islands</b> merited
this designation from the circumstance that when
Magellan touched upon one of the lesser isles of the
group in 1520 the natives stole some of his goods;
whereupon he called the Islands the <i>Ladrones</i>, which
is the Spanish for thieves. <b>Pitcairn’s Island</b> was
discovered by Pitcairn in 1768. <b>Easter Island</b> was
so denominated by Jacob Roggevin in consequence
of his visit to its fertile shores on Easter Sunday,
1722; the island having previously been discovered
by Captain Davis in 1686. <b>Vancouver Island</b>
preserves the memory of Captain Vancouver, a midshipman
under Captain Cook, who discovered it in
1792, while cruising about in search of a river on the
west coast of North America. The <b>Aleutian Islands</b>
expresses the Russian for “bald rocks.” <b>Queen
Charlotte Island</b> was named in compliment to the
queen of George III.; and <b>Prince of Wales Island</b>,
after the Prince Regent, afterwards George IV.
<b>Barrow Island</b>, discovered by Captain Penny in
1850, received the name of John Barrow, son of Sir
John Barrow, the eminent statesman; while <b>Baring
Island</b>, also discovered by Penny in the course of
the same voyage, received the name of Sir Francis
Baring, First Lord of the Admiralty. The <b>Parry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Islands</b> and <b>Baffin Land</b> indicate the names of
the famous Arctic navigators to whom their discovery
was due. <b>Banks Land</b> was so called in compliment
to Sir Joseph Banks, the eminent naturalist and
President of the Royal Society.</p>

<p><b>Newfoundland</b> is the only territory discovered
by Cabot which has been allowed to retain its
original name. <b>Rhode Island</b>, a corruption of the
Danish <i>rood</i>, red, signifies Red Island, in allusion to
its reddish appearance; whereas <b>Long Island</b> has
reference to its long and narrow conformation. The
<b>Bermuda Islands</b> were discovered by Juan Bermudez
in 1522. <b>San Salvador</b> means “Holy
Saviour.” This was the first land sighted by
Columbus (October 11, 1492); he therefore gave it
this name, as a token of thanksgiving. <b>Jamaica</b> is
a corruption of <i>Xaymaco</i>, a native West Indian name
signifying “the country abounding in springs.” <b>Cuba</b>
and <b>Hayti</b> are also native names, the latter meaning
“mountainous country.” The Island of <b>Barbadoes</b>
derived its name from the Latin <i>barba</i>, a beard, in
allusion to the beard-like streamers of moss always
hanging from the branches of the trees. <b>Dominica</b>
is indicative of the day of its discovery by Columbus,
namely, Sunday, November 2, 1493; and <b>Porto
Rico</b> is likewise Spanish for “rich port.” When
Columbus first sighted the Isle of <b>Trinidad</b> he
discerned three mountain peaks rising from the sea,
thus conveying the impression of three distinct
islands; but on approaching nearer he discovered
that they formed one piece of land only; wherefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
he gave the island the name of the Trinity, of which
it was so eminently an emblem. But perhaps the
most interesting of the West Indies in connection
with the subject we are now discussing is <b>Tobago
Island</b>, so called by Columbus from its fancied resemblance
to the <i>Tobaco</i>, or inhaling tube of the
aborigines, whence the word <span class="smcap">Tobacco</span> has been
derived. <b>St. Kitt’s Island</b> is an abbreviation of
St. Christopher’s Island, so called by Columbus in
1493 after his patron saint.</p>

<p><b>Ascension Island</b> was discovered by the Portuguese
on Ascension Day, 1501; and the <b>Isle
of St. Helena</b> on the Feast of St. Helena, 1502.
<b>Tristan d’Acunha</b> received the name of the Portuguese
navigator who discovered it in 1651. The
<b>Canary Islands</b> were originally so called on account
of the numerous dogs, as well as of their unusual
size (Latin <i>canis</i>, a dog), bred here. <b>Madeira</b>
is a Portuguese term signifying timber; the inference
being that this island was formerly covered
by an immense forest. <b>Majorca</b> and <b>Minorca</b>,
literally in accordance with the Latin <i>major</i> and
<i>minor</i>, the Greater and Lesser Island, are denominated
also the <b>Balearic Islands</b> from the
Greek <i>ballein</i>, to throw, because their inhabitants
were anciently noted slingers. <b>Corsica</b> is a Phœnician
word denoting “the wooded island”; <b>Sardinia</b>
expresses the “land of the Sardonion,” a Greek
term for a plant indigenous to this island; <b>Capri</b>
signifies the “island of goats,” agreeably to the
Latin <i>caper</i>, a he-goat; <b>Sicily</b> received its name from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the <i>Siculi</i>, a tribe who settled upon it in early times;
<b>Malta</b> was anciently <i>Melita</i>, “the place of refuge”;
<b>Candia</b> comes from the Arabic <i>Khandæ</i>, “the island
of trenches”; and <b>Cyprus</b> from the Greek <i>Kupros</i>,
the name of a herb with which the island abounded;
while <b>Rhodes</b> indicates an “island of roses,” in
conformity with the Greek <i>rhodon</i>, a rose.</p>

<p><b>Belleisle</b> is French for “beautiful island”;
<b>Jersey</b> was originally <i>Czar’s-ey</i>, meaning “Cæsar’s
Island,” so called by the Romans in honour of
Julius Cæsar; the <b>Isle of Wight</b> denoted in the
long, long ago the Island of the Wyts, or Jutes; just
as <b>Gothland</b> indicated a settlement of the Goths.
<b>Heligoland</b> expresses the Danish for “holy island
settlement.” <b>Anglesea</b> is really a corruption of
<i>Anglesey</i>, signifying, in accordance with the suffix <i>ey</i>,
the Isle of the Angles [<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_158"><span class="smcap">Chelsea</span></a>]. The <b>Isle of
Man</b> is the modern designation of <b>Mona Island</b>,
by which was meant, agreeably to the Celtic <i>mæn</i>,
a stone “rocky island.” The <b>Hebrides</b> were
anciently referred to by Ptolemy as the <i>Ebudæ</i>, and
by Pliny as the <i>Hebudes</i>, denoting the “Western
Isles”; the <b>Orkney Isles</b> expresses the Gaelic for
the “Isles of Whales,” alluding to their situation;
and the <b>Shetland Isles</b>, the Norse for the “Viking
Island,” conformably with their native prenomen
<i>Hyalti</i>, a Viking. The term <span class="smcap">Viking</span>, by the way,
meaning a pirate, was derived from the <i>Vik</i>, or creek,
in which he lay concealed. The name of <b>Iceland</b>
needs no comment, further than that, perhaps, the
north and west coasts of the island are frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
blockaded with ice, which has drifted before the wind
from Greenland. <b>Spitzbergen</b> is literal Dutch for
“sharp-pointed mountains,” referring to the granite
peaks of the mountains, which are so characteristic
of this group of islands; while <b>Nova Zembla</b> presents
a strange mixture of the Latin and Slavonic,
literally “new land.”</p>

<h2 id="THE_MONTHS_AND_DAYS_OF_THE"><i>THE MONTHS, AND DAYS OF THE
WEEK.</i></h2>

<p>The titles of the months are modernized forms
of those in use among the Romans, namely:&mdash;<b>January</b>,
in honour of Janus, a deity who
presided over the beginning of everything; <b>February</b>,
from the Latin word <i>febru</i>, to purify, because the
purification of women took place in this month;
<b>March</b>, after Mars, the God of War; <b>April</b>, from
<i>aperio</i>, to open, this being the month in which the
buds shoot forth; <b>May</b>, after Maia, the mother of
Mercury, to whom sacrifices were offered on the first
day of this month; <b>June</b>, from Juno, the queen
goddess; <b>July</b>, the name given to this month by
Marc Antony in honour of Julius Cæsar, who was
born in it; <b>August</b>, named by Augustus Cæsar after
himself, because in this month he celebrated three
distinct triumphs, reduced Egypt to subjection, and
put an end to the civil wars; while <b>September</b>,
<b>October</b>, <b>November</b>, and <b>December</b> literally express
the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth months of
the old Roman Calendar, counted from March, which
commenced the year previous to the addition of
January and February by Numa in the year 713 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The Egyptian astronomers were the first to distinguish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the days by names, when, as might have
been expected, they called them after the Sun, the
Moon, and the five planets, viz., Mars, Mercury,
Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn. Of these the two first
and the last survive, but for the rest the names of as
many gods of the Scandinavian mythology have been
substituted. Nowadays, then, we have the following:&mdash;<b>Sunday</b>,
originally signifying the day upon which
the sun was worshipped; <b>Monday</b>, the day of the
moon; <b>Tuesday</b> devoted to Tiw, the God of War;
<b>Wednesday</b>, set apart for the worship of Odin, or
Wodin, the God of Magic and the Inventor of the
Arts; <b>Thursday</b>, the day of Thor, the son of Odin
(or Wodin), and the God of Thunder; <b>Friday</b>, allotted
to Frigga, the wife of Odin, and the Goddess of
Marriage; and <b>Saturday</b>, the day of Saturn, one of
the planets of the solar system.</p>

<h2 id="CREEDS_SECTS_AND_DENOMINATIONS"><i>CREEDS, SECTS, AND DENOMINATIONS.</i></h2>

<p><b>Theism</b> and <b>Deism</b> both express a belief in
God; the former term being derived from
the Greek <i>Theos</i>, God, and the latter from
the Latin, <i>Deus</i>, God. The <b>Theist</b>, however,
admits the <b>Theocracy</b> or Government of God
(Greek <i>Theos</i>, God, and <i>kratein</i>, to govern); the
<b>Deist</b>, on the contrary, maintains that God in the
beginning implanted in all His works certain immutable
laws, comprehended by mankind under the
name of the “Laws of Nature,” which act of themselves,
and are no longer subject to the supervision
of the Creator. <b>Pantheism</b> (from the Greek <i>pan</i>,
all, everything, and <i>Theos</i>, God) is the religion which
rejects a belief in a personal God, but recognizes Him
in all the processes, and works, and glories, and
beauties of Nature, and animated creation. Briefly,
the <b>Pantheist</b> holds the doctrine that “God is
everything, and everything is God.” The word
<b>Atheism</b> comes from the Greek <i>Theos</i>, God, and the
prefix <i>a</i>, without. An <b>Atheist</b>, therefore, practically
answers to the description given by David in the
opening line of <i>Psalm</i> xiv., “The fool hath said in his
heart, There is no God.” <b>Agnosticism</b> is also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Greek, in accordance with the prefix <i>a</i>, without,
and <i>gnomi</i>, to know. An <b>Agnostic</b> is one whose belief
is confined to that which he <i>knows</i> and sees, and
who rejects everything at all beyond his understanding.
<b>Secularism</b>, derived from the Latin
<i>seculum</i>, an age, a generation, is the term given to
the principles advocated by Messrs. Holyoake in
1846, which professed an entire independence of
religion, except so far as it pertains to this life. The
<b>Secularist</b> aims at promoting the happiness of the
community during the present life. His religion is
that of this world, without troubling himself about
possibilities concerning a life hereafter. Such views
are closely allied to those set forth by John Stuart
Mill (born 1806, died 1873) under the name of
<b>Utilitarianism</b>, by which was meant, “the happiness
of the greatest number.” This term was based
upon the Latin <i>utilitas</i>, usefulness. <b>Spiritualism</b>
expresses a belief in the soul’s immortality, as
opposed to the doctrine of <b>Materialism</b>, which contends
that the soul, or thinking part of man, is the
result of some peculiar organization of matter in
the body, with which it must necessarily die.
<b>Rationalism</b> constitutes the doctrine which accepts
the test of Reason and Experience in the pursuit of
knowledge, particularly in regard to religious truth,
rejecting the gift of Faith, Revelation, and everything
connected with the supernatural or miraculous.
This was the religion (!) of the French Revolutionists,
who set up an actress to be publicly
honoured as the “Goddess of Reason” in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Cathedral of Nôtre Dame on the 10th of November,
1793.</p>

<p>The earliest form of religion on the face of the earth
was <b>Monotheism</b>, so called from the Greek <i>monos</i>,
alone, only, and <i>Theos</i>, God; therefore signifying
a belief in, and the worship of, one Only God. The
word <b>Religion</b> is derived from the Latin <i>religare</i>,
to bind. Hence, Religion implies obedience, submission,
and an acknowledgment of certain orthodox
doctrines regarding our duty to a Supreme Power.
<b>Mosaism</b>, otherwise <b>Judaism</b>, denotes the religion
of the Jews as enjoined in the laws of Moses. But
even during that favoured period when God manifested
Himself in various ways to the children of
Israel, Idolatry prevailed. Let us consider what
this word <b>Idolatry</b> really means. <i>Idol</i> is a contraction
of the Greek <i>eidolon</i>, the diminutive of <i>eidos</i>,
a figure, an image, or that which is seen, derived from
the verb <i>eidein</i>, to see; while <b>Idolater</b> is made up of
the two Greek words, <i>eidolon</i>, and <i>latres</i>, one who
pays homage, a worshipper. An Idolater, therefore,
is a worshipper of images, or that which he sees.
The Israelites, who prostrated themselves before the
Golden Calf, were strictly Idolaters; so were the
Egyptians, who worshipped the sun, the moon, the ox,
the dog, the cat, the ibis, and the ichneumon; but the
Greeks and Romans were scarcely Idolaters, because
the mythological deities they worshipped were
unseen&mdash;as unseen as is the True God Himself.
Neither were they <b>Pagans</b>, which term, from the
Latin <i>paganus</i>, a countryman, a peasant, based upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
<i>pagus</i>, a country, a district, has nothing whatever to
do with religion. The Greeks and Romans were,
in fact, <b>Polytheists</b>, and their religion was <b>Polytheism</b>,
signifying, in accordance with the Greek
<i>polus</i>, many, and <i>Theos</i>, God, a belief in more gods
than one. The more general description of the
religion of the ancients is comprised in the term
<b>Mythology</b>, written in the Greek <i>muthologia</i>, from
<i>muthos</i>, a fable, and <i>logos</i>, a discourse.</p>

<p>Alluding to the <b>Fire Worshippers</b> of the East,
who fall prostrate in adoration of the sun, it should
be noted that these do not actually worship the sun,
but God, whom they believe to reside in it. This
Sun or Fire Worship, the religion of the <b>Parsees</b>,
otherwise denominated <b>Zoroastrianism</b>, was introduced
into Persia by Zoroaster about five hundred
years before the Christian era. In short,
the Parsees are the descendants of those who, in
Persia, adhered to the Zoroastrian religion after
the Moslem or Mahommedan conquest of their
country, whence they were at length driven by
Moslem persecution to migrate to India. The
<b>Brahmins</b> are the priests or higher caste of the
Hindoos, who, like the Burmese, the inhabitants
of the adjacent country, <b>Burmah</b>, claim to be
descended from <i>Brahma</i>, the supreme deity of the
Hindoo religion. The <b>Buddhists</b> are the followers
of Buddha, a Hindoo sage who founded the doctrine
of <b>Buddhism</b> in the sixth century <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> <b>Mahommedanism</b>
is the religion founded by Mahommed,
or Mahomet (born 571, died 632). The term<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
<b>Koran</b>, or more properly <i>Al Koran</i>, “The Koran,”
which constitutes the Bible of the Mahommedans,
is Arabic for a “Reading,” a “thing to be read.”
The native name of the Mahommedan religion is
<b>Islam</b>, resignation and obedience to God, founded
upon the verb <i>aslama</i>, to bend, to submit, to surrender.
The Mahommedans of Turkey and Persia
usually bear the style of <b>Mussulmans</b>, a corruption
and the plural of the Arabic <i>muslim</i>, rendered into
English as <b>Moslem</b>, and meaning a true believer, or
one who holds the faith of Islam.</p>

<p>Our reference to Mahommedanism having carried
us some six hundred years beyond the foundation of
<b>Christianity</b> by Christ, we must of necessity
retrace our steps. Reverting to the Jewish people
contemporary with Jesus Christ and His disciples,
a certain portion of these styled themselves
<b>Pharisees</b> because they affected a greater degree
of holiness than their neighbours. The name was
derived from the Hebrew word <i>pharash</i>, separated.
The <b>Nazarenes</b>, so called after “Jesus of Nazareth,”
were a sect of semi-converted Jews, who, while
believing Christ to be the long-promised Messiah,
and that His nature was Divine as well as human,
nevertheless continued the rites and ceremonies
peculiar to Judaism. The <b>Gnostics</b>, otherwise
the “Knowers,” pursuant to the Greek <i>gnomi</i>, to
know, were those who tried to accommodate the
Scriptures to the speculations of Plato, Pythagoras,
and other ancient philosophers; having done which
to their own satisfaction they refused all further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
knowledge on the subject. The <b>Aquarians</b> (Latin
<i>aqua</i>, water) insisted upon the use of water in the
place of wine in the Communion. The <b>Arians</b>
were the followers of Arius, a presbyter in the
Church of Alexandria, universally regarded as the
first heretic. Soon after his death (in 336), which
was ignominious in the extreme, the Arians renounced
their errors, and were readmitted into the
Church; but this gave offence to another section of
the Christians under Lucifer, Bishop of Cagliari,
styling themselves the <b>Luciferians</b>, who refused
all communication with the reconverted heretics.
The <b>Donatists</b> were the followers of Donatus,
Bishop of Numidia; the <b>Macedonians</b>, of Macedonius,
Patriarch of Constantinople; the <b>Apollinarians</b>,
of Apollinarius, Bishop of Laodicea and
Greek Christian philosopher. These various sects
arose in the fourth century of the Church.</p>

<p>The term <b>Catholic</b>, derived from the Greek
<i>Katholos</i>, compounded out of <i>Kata</i>, throughout, and
<i>olos</i>, whole, signifies One, Universal. During the
first nine centuries of Christianity the <b>Catholic
Church</b> was indeed universal; but at that epoch
it became necessary to distinguish between the
Eastern or Greek Church, and the Western or
Church of Rome, by adding the word “Roman”
to the original Church founded by St. Peter and
perpetuated by his successors the Popes. The
<b>Greek Church</b>, which constitutes the orthodox
religion of Greece, Moldavia, and Russia, differs
principally from the Roman Catholic in regard to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the Papal supremacy, and the doctrine of Holy
Ghost proceeding from the Father and the Son.
The employment of the full title of <b>Roman
Catholic Church</b> is at all times necessary in
England when alluding to Christian doctrine in
order to avoid probable confusion with the Established
Church of this country which retains in its
Creed the designation of “The Holy Catholic
Church.” This is because at the Reformation the
<b>Church of England</b>, then styled the <b>Anglican
Church</b>, professed to be the Catholic Church
governed by the reigning monarch instead of the
Pope of Rome.</p>

<p>The <b>Gallican Church</b> is the so-called Church of
France or Gaul, the ancient name of the country.
Père Hyacinth, its founder, whose church was
opened in Paris February 7, 1870, originally separated
from the Church of Rome owing to his disapproval
of the enforced celibacy of the clergy. The
<b>Lutheran Church</b> of Germany took its name from
Martin Luther (born 1483, died 1546), the monk
who became the pioneer of <b>Protestantism</b>. In the
year 1529 the Emperor Charles V. summoned a
Diet at Spiers for the avowed object of enlisting the
aid of the German Princes against the Turks, but
really to devise some means of tranquillizing the
disturbances which had grown out of Luther’s
opposition to the Church of Rome, and restoring
the national religion. Against a decree drawn up
at this Diet six princes and the deputies of thirteen
imperial towns offered a vehement <i>protest</i>, and ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
afterwards the <b>Lutherans</b> were in consequence
styled <b>Protestants</b>. The first Standard of Faith,
according to the doctrines of Luther, is known as
<b>The Augsburg Confession</b>, because it was presented
by Luther and Melancthon to Charles V.,
during the sitting of the Imperial Diet at Augsburg
in the year 1530.</p>

<p>The <b>Calvinists</b> were the followers of John Calvin
(born 1509, died 1604), the zealous reformer of
Switzerland. In due time these also styled themselves
Protestants. From Switzerland Protestantism
spread into France through the energy of a Genevese
Calvinist named Hugh or Hugue, after whom the
French Protestants adopted the name of <b>Huguenots</b>.</p>

<p>But Luther and Calvin were by no means the
earliest of the reformers.</p>

<p>In England the <b>Wycliffites</b>, or followers of John
Wycliffe (born 1324, died 1387), became known as
<b>Gospellers</b>, after their leader had completed the
translation of the Bible in 1377. Eventually they
adopted the title of <b>Lollards</b>, in imitation of a sect
of German reformers headed by Walter Lollard,
a dissolute priest, who turned theologian and was
publicly burned for heresy at Cologne in 1322. In
France the precursors of the Huguenots were the
<b>Albigenses</b> of Languedoc, so called because their
capital was Albi, and its people were called the
Albigeois, early in the twelfth century; and in 1170,
the <b>Waldenses</b>, inhabiting the wooded districts of
Valdois and Piedmont. The latter received their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
designation in accordance with the German <i>walden</i>,
forests. The <b>Camisards</b>, or wearers of the <i>Camisè</i>,
a peasant’s smock, to conceal their armour, comprised
a body of Protestant insurgents who took
up arms in the district of the Cevennes after the
revocation of the Edict of Nantes by Louis XIV.,
October 22, 1685. As these always conducted their
attacks upon the soldiery under cover of the darkness
the term “Camisard” in military parlance
soon came to imply a night attack. The Protestants
of Bohemia were styled <b>Hussites</b>, after John Huss
(born 1373, burned 1415); they were also known as
<b>Bethlemites</b> from the Church of Bethlehem in
Prague, in which Huss used to hurl forth his
denunciations against the Church of Rome. The
<b>Moravians</b>, otherwise <b>The United Brethren</b>,
who were driven by persecutions from Moravia and
Bohemia in the last century, claimed to be descendants
of the original Hussites.</p>

<p>Having now traced the rise of Protestantism
generally, let us at once dispose of the various sects
and denominations before confining ourselves to the
Established Church and its offshoots.</p>

<p>The <b>Adamites</b> were the fanatical followers of one
Picard, in Bohemia, self-styled “Adam, Son of God,”
who, about the year 1400, proposed to reduce mankind
to a state of primitive innocence and enjoyment.
No clothes were worn, wives were held in common,
and many other violations of Nature were committed
ere they finally disappeared from the face of the earth.
A similar sect were the <b>Libertines</b>, in Holland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
These contended that nothing could be regarded as
sinful in a community where each was at full liberty
to act up to his natural dictates and passions. The
<b>Jansenists</b> favoured the doctrines of Jansenius,
Bishop of Ypres, in France (born 1585, died 1638).
For a long period these maintained an open warfare
with the <b>Jesuists</b>, properly, soldiers of the “Society
of Jesus” [<i>see</i> <a href="#RELIGIOUS_ORDERS"><span class="smcap">Religious Orders</span></a>], until they were
finally put down by Pope Clement in 1705. The
<b>Gabrielites</b> were a sect of Anabaptists of Germany
in the sixteenth century, named after Gabriel
Scherling, their founder. The <b>Labadists</b> were a
sect of Protestant ascetics of the seventeenth
century who conformed to the rules laid down by
Jean Labadie, of Bourg, in Germany. The <b>Socinians</b>,
a sect corresponding to the modern
<b>Unitarians</b>, owed their existence to Lælius Socinus,
an Italian theologian in 1546. The anti-Calvinists
of Holland were styled <b>Arminians</b>, after the
Latinized name (Jacobus Arminius) of their leader,
James Harmensen (born 1560, died 1609). The
<b>New Christians</b> comprised a number of Portuguese
Jews in the fifteenth century, who, although they
consented to be baptized under compulsion, still
practised the Mosaic rites and ceremonies in secret.
The <b>Old Catholics</b> of Germany are the followers of
the late Dr. Döllinger, of Munich (born 1799, died
1890), who refused to accept the dogma of the
infallibility of the Pope promulgated July 18, 1870.</p>

<p>In our own country the <b>Scotists</b> were those who
adopted the opinions of John Duns Scotus (born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
1272, died 1308), concerning the doctrines of the Immaculate
Conception, in opposition to the <b>Thomists</b>,
or followers of St. Thomas Aquinas (born 1227, died
1274), who denied that the Virgin was conceived
without sin. The <b>Sabbatarians</b>, known also as the
<b>Seventh Day Baptists</b>, founded by Brabourne, a
clergyman who, about the year 1628, maintained that
the seventh day was the real Sabbath as ordained
at the beginning. The <b>Fifth Monarchy Men</b>,
who came into existence during the reign of Charles
I., believed in the early coming of Jesus Christ to
re-establish the four great monarchies of the ancient
world, viz., the Assyrian, Persian, Macedonian, and
Roman, contemporaneously with the fifth, the Millennium.
The <b>Muggletonians</b> were the followers
of one Ludovic Muggleton, a journeyman tailor, who
set himself up as a prophet in 1651. The <b>Society
of Friends</b> originally styled themselves <b>Seekers</b>,
because they sought the truth after the manner
of Nicodemus, the Jewish ruler, as narrated in <i>St.
John</i> iii. 1-21. They were first designated <b>Quakers</b>
by Justice Bennet of Derby, in 1650, in consequence
of George Fox, the founder, having admonished him
and all present to quake on hearing the Word of
the Lord. The Seekers came into existence in 1646.
The <b>White Quakers</b>, who seceded from the
main body about 1840, are distinguished by their
white clothing. The original sect of the <b>Shakers</b>,
first heard of in the time of Charles I., received its
name from the convulsive movements indulged in
by its members as part of their peculiar form of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
worship. The modern sect sprang from a body of
expelled Quakers, headed by James Wardley, in
1747. They emigrated to America in May, 1772,
and formed a permanent settlement near Albany,
New York, two years afterwards. The <b>Mormons</b>
derived their designation from “The Book of
Mormon,” claimed to be a lost portion of the Bible
written by the angel Mormon, the last of the Hebrew
line of prophets, and found inscribed in Egyptian
characters upon plates of gold by Joseph Smith, the
founder of the sect, in the year 1827. This work
was really written by the Rev. Solomon Spalding,
who died in 1816. Joseph Smith died in 1844. The
<b>Peculiar People</b> are so styled because they believe
in the efficacy of prayer on the part of their elders,
and the anointing with oil in the name of the Lord
for the cure of sickness as set forth in <i>James</i> v. 14.
This sect was first heard of in London in 1838.
The <b>Faith Healers</b>, or those who uphold the
doctrine of Healing by Faith, lately sprung up in
our midst, may be regarded as an offshoot of the
Peculiar People. The <b>Irvingites</b> are the followers
of Edward Irving, a Scottish divine (born 1792, died
1834), who maintained that Christ was liable to
commit sin in common with the rest of mankind.
The <b>Humanitarians</b> incline to the same belief.
The <b>Sacramentarians</b> are those who deny the
Real Presence in the Holy Eucharist: the Calvinists
were originally known by this title. The <b>Plymouth
Brethren</b> first appeared at Plymouth about the
year 1830; they so style themselves because they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
confess Christ as a fraternal community and do not
recognize any order of priesthood. The <b>Perfectionists</b>
of North America are so called owing to
their rejection of civil laws, on the plea that the
guidance of the Holy Spirit suffices for all earthly
as well as spiritual affairs. Another body of co-coreligionists
peculiar to North America are the
<b>Hopkinsians</b>, named after Samuel Hopkins, of
Connecticut, their founder. The doctrines which
they hold are mainly Calvinistic.</p>

<p>The <b>Scottish Covenanters</b> were those who
subscribed to a solemn league or covenant to stand
by each other in opposition to the religious and
political measures of Charles I. This occurred in
1638. In less than ten years afterwards the
Covenanters, having increased in numbers and power,
assumed the entire direction of their own ecclesiastical
affairs and styled themselves <b>Presbyterians</b>,
a term derived from the Greek <i>presbuteros</i>, an elder,
because they contended that the government of the
Church as set forth in the New Testament was by
presbyters, equal in office, power, and order. The
national Church of Scotland, therefore, when at
length it was recognized by the English Parliament,
bore the title of the <b>Scottish Presbyterian
Church</b>. It was, however, not long before dissensions
became rife. The strictest body of the
Presbyterians adopted the style of <b>Cameronians</b>,
after the name of their leader, Archibald Cameron,
who was executed in 1688 on account of his
religious opinions; while an equally numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
body, headed by John Macmillan, became known as
<b>Macmillanites</b>, and also as <b>The Reformed
Presbytery</b>. A much later sect was that founded
in 1841 by James Morison, under the designation
of the <b>Morisonians</b>. But the most alarming split
in the Presbyterian Church took place May 18, 1843,
when Dr. Chalmers, with a large following, established
a separate community, entitled <b>The Free
Church of Scotland</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>Puritans</b> of England were to the Established
Church what the Pharisees were to the Jews. And
not only did these Puritans profess a greater purity
of doctrine, of morals, and of living, than their
neighbours, but they embraced the earliest opportunity
of separating themselves from the Church of
England altogether. They were, in fact, the first of
the Dissenters. On August 24, 1662, which date
witnessed the secession of nearly two thousand
ministers from the Church of England through their
non-compliance with the “Act of Uniformity,” the
Puritans joined forces with the latter, and the
combined body assumed the name of <b>Nonconformists</b>.
The Protestants were, consequently,
divided into two great parties&mdash;the <b>Conformists</b>, or
those who conformed to the requirements laid down
in the “Act of Conformity,” and the <b>Nonconformists</b>.
The latter have in more recent times borne
the name of <b>Dissenters</b>, because they dissent from
the Established Church. The <b>Sectarians</b> are
Dissenters who attach themselves to one or other of
the numerous sects and denominations which exist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
outside the Church of England. The <b>Congregationalists</b>
and the <b>Independents</b> are one and the
same. They maintain that each congregation is an
independent religious community entitled to exercise
the right of appointing its own ministers and
managing its own affairs. These tenets were first
publicly advanced by Robert Brown, a violent opponent
of the Established Church, in Rutlandshire,
as early as the year 1585. The <b>Unitarians</b> are the
modern <b>Socinians</b> already alluded to. They are
opposed to the doctrine of the Trinity; and, consequently,
to the <b>Trinitarians</b>. The <b>Baptists</b> not
only reject infant baptism, but hold that the adult
subject should be baptized after the manner in which
Christ was baptized by St. John. On this account
the original Baptists, who arose about 1521, received
the name of <b>Anabaptists</b>, because, having been
already baptized during infancy, they of necessity
went through the ceremony a second time on
arriving at full age. The prefix <i>ana</i> is Greek,
signifying twice. The followers of John Wesley (born
1703, died 1791) and his brother, Charles Wesley
(born 1708, died 1788), were styled <b>Methodists</b>,
owing to the methodical strictness of their lives and
religious exercises. They were also denominated
<b>Wesleyans</b>, or <b>Wesleyan Methodists</b>, in contradistinction
to the <b>Primitive Methodists</b>, or
<b>Ranters</b>, who separated from the original sect
under Hugh Bourne, in 1810, and retained the style
of open-air preaching peculiar to John Wesley in
his early itinerant days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>The terms “High Church” and “Low Church”
first came into prominence during the reign of
Queen Anne. Nowadays, as then, that section is
styled <b>High Church</b> which regards the Church of
England as the only ark of salvation, while the
less apprehensive and more moderate section is
called <b>Low Church</b>. Those who take a still more
liberal and comprehensive view of orthodox doctrine
belong to what is known as the <b>Broad
Church</b>, which is but another name for <b>Latitudinarianism</b>,
as originally professed by a number
of divines opposed alike to the Puritans and the
High Church party in the time of Charles I. On
the other hand, the <b>Ritualists</b> comprise the extreme
High Church party who are anxious to return to
the ritual of public worship in vogue during the
reign of Edward VI. Prior to 1866, in which year
the term arose, these High Churchmen bore the
name of <b>Puseyites</b>, because they agreed with the
views set forth by Dr. Pusey in his celebrated
“Tracts for the Times,” published at Oxford
between 1833 and 1841. Those scholars who
assisted Dr. Pusey in the composition of these
<b>Oxford Tracts</b>, as they were called, as well as the
public at large who believed in their teaching, were
styled <b>Tractarians</b>; while the great Roman Catholic
revival that took place in the Church of England at
this period universally bore, and still bears, the name
of the <b>Oxford Movement</b>.</p>

<h2 id="TAVERN_SIGNS"><i>TAVERN SIGNS.</i></h2>

<p><b>Hotel</b> is a French term, derived from <i>hostil</i>,
a lordly house, a palace. The designation
<b>Public House</b>, signifying a house of public
resort for refreshment and conviviality, is a modern
substitute for <b>Tavern</b>, derived from the Latin
<i>taberna</i>, a hut, a wooden booth; frequently also for
<b>Inn</b>, or rather, as originally written, <i>Inne</i>, which
expressed the Anglo-Saxon for a mansion. And
here we may at once observe that by far the
majority of our mediæval inns and <b>Hostelries</b>
[<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_77"><span class="smcap">Hotel</span></a>] grew out of the mansions of the
nobility during the prolonged absence of their
owners. At such times the privilege of utilizing
the mansion for his own profit naturally fell to the
family’s most trustworthy dependent, viz., the head
gamekeeper, whose green costume gave existence to
the sign of <b>The Green Man</b>, when, after quitting
the family’s service, he set up an inn on his own
account either in connection with his own cottage or
abutting on the public highway. Nevertheless, this
sign had nothing in common with that of <b>The
Green Man and Still</b>, expressive of a herbalist
bringing his herbs to a distillery, and which was
doubtless the sign of a herbalist turned innkeeper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>As the family arms always occupied a prominent
position on the front of the mansion these soon
became known far and wide, though scarcely in
accordance with their full heraldic significance.
Briefly, the most conspicuous object in them sufficed
to impress itself upon the minds of travellers as the
distinguishing sign of the establishment; so that,
instead of speaking of <i>lions gules</i> and <i>lions azure</i>, &amp;c.,
they simplified matters by referring to red and blue
lions, &amp;c. Such was the origin, then, of <b>The Red
Lion</b>, <b>The Blue Lion</b>, and many another familiar
sign of this character. Moreover, as a variation of
the same device entered into the arms of different
families, it happened that the most conspicuous
object in them became popular in different parts of
the country at the same time. Another fruitful
source of the rapid multiplication of a particular
sign throughout the same county, and even upon the
same estate, was the fact that as often as a retired
dependent of a nobleman’s family turned innkeeper,
he was pretty certain to name his establishment in
accordance with the popular description of the
original inn or mansion. If it chanced, however,
that that sign had already been appropriated by
another innkeeper in the immediate vicinity, the
full cognizance of the ground landlord was adopted.
Thus, in the Midland Counties there is no sign so
common as <b>The Bear and Ragged Staff</b>, which
was the cognizance of the Earl of Warwick, the
King Maker. Similarly, <b>The Boar’s Head</b> was
the cognizance of the Gordons; <b>The Black Bull</b>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
that of the House of Clare; and <b>The Talbot</b>, that
of the House of Shrewsbury. Another oft-to-be-met-with
sign is <b>The Chequers</b>, which comprised the
arms of the Earls of Fitzwarren who, in the time of
the Plantagenets, held the right of granting the
vintners their licences. Later in our history the
same cognizance was adopted by the Stuarts. As
every one is aware, <b>The Red Rose</b> was the recognized
badge of the Lancastrians, and <b>The White
Rose</b> that of the Yorkists. It may be assumed
that these two signs were naturally more popular
throughout the country at large during the <b>Wars
of the Roses</b> than at any subsequent period.
During that turbulent period of English history,
too, the devices of the several adherents of the rival
houses were not unfrequently chosen in commemoration
of a particular event; as, for example, after
the Battle of Barnet, when <b>The Star</b>, the badge of
the Earl of Oxford who decided the fate of that day,
sprang up as an inn-sign in all directions, except, of
course, upon Yorkist ground.</p>

<p>Where the innkeeper was not bound by any ties
of gratitude or regard to the ground landlord he
evinced his loyalty to the reigning monarch by
adopting a portion of the royal arms. As examples
of this class:&mdash;<b>The White Swan</b> was the badge of
Edward III. and of Henry IV.; <b>The White Swan
and Antelope</b>, of Henry V.; <b>The White Hart</b>,
and <b>The Sun</b>, both of Richard II.; <b>The White
Lion</b>, of Edward IV. as Earl of March, and <b>The
Three Suns</b>, of Edward IV. as King of England;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
<b>The Eagle</b>, of Queen Mary; <b>The Blue Boar</b>, of
Richard III.; <b>The Red Dragon</b>, that of Henry
VII., chosen for his standard after the Battle of
Bosworth Field, and <b>The Greyhound</b>, his original
badge as King. <b>The Rose</b> is the symbol of England,
just as <b>The Thistle</b> stands for Scotland, <b>The
Shamrock</b> for Ireland, and <b>The Leek</b> for Wales.
A very general expression of loyalty, again, was
conveyed in the sign of <b>The Crown</b>, which, by the
way, was shrewdly complimentary to the reigning
house without offering offence to the partisans of a
rival claimant to the throne. <b>The Rose and
Crown</b> had reference originally to the union of the
red and white roses in the House of Tudor by the
marriage of Henry VII. with Elizabeth, the daughter
of Edward IV., in the year 1486; <b>The Crown and
Sceptre</b> must have originated in the mind of one
who had been witness to the elaborate ceremonial
peculiar to a coronation; while <b>The Crown
and Anchor</b> signified the reliance which was placed
in the exalted person that wore the crown.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, our mediæval innkeeper
chose to flatter the ground landlord without actually
adopting his cognizance, he invariably named his
establishment after his lordship’s family title, <i>e.g.</i>,
<b>The Earl of March</b>, in compliment to the Duke
of Richmond, or else set up some such sign as <b>The
Hare and Hounds</b>, <b>The Tally Ho!</b>, <b>The Fox
in the Hole</b>, &amp;c., in allusion to the sporting tastes
of his patron. At times he even went so far as to
enter into the religious enthusiasm of the latter by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
exhibiting a preference for <b>The Angel</b> or <b>The
Salutation</b>, both referring to the Annunciation of
the Virgin; <b>The Three Kings</b>, meaning the Magi
who presented themselves to the Infant at Bethlehem;
or <b>The Cross Keys</b>, the symbol of St.
Peter, and the badge of the Archbishop of York.
The sign of <b>The Mitre</b> was generally adopted by
an innkeeper whose establishment stood in the
vicinity of a cathedral; consequently, this particular
sign abounds in cities, but is rarely to be met with
in the rural districts.</p>

<p>During the period of the Holy Wars, if the
innkeeper did not content himself with the sign of
<b>The Turk’s Head</b> or <b>The Saracen’s Head</b>, that
of <b>The Golden Cross</b>, which was the ensign carried
by the Crusaders, was usually chosen. The modern
sign of <b>The Half-Moon</b> originated in the crescent,
the ensign of the Infidel. The signs of <b>The Swan</b>,
<b>The Pheasant</b>, and <b>The Peacock</b> arose in the
days of knight-errantry, when every knight selected
one of these birds as an emblem of chivalry, and
exerted a pride in the association. For example,
one of the principal characters in the “Niebelungen
Lied” is called “The Knight of the Swan.” Then,
again, many innkeepers assumed a sign in honour of
the patron saint of England, or in commemoration
of his combat with the dragon, viz., <b>The St. George</b>,
<b>The St. George and Dragon</b>, <b>The George and
Dragon</b>, <b>The Green Dragon</b>, &amp;c. <b>The George</b>,
a common sign enough in our own day&mdash;it would be
difficult to name a town that has not its “George”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
in the High Street&mdash;was originally connected with
the dragon too; but at the commencement of the
Hanoverian succession the heraldic device was
painted out altogether, and the words <span class="smcap">The George</span>
were put up in its place. The like observation
applies to all such signs as <b>The King’s Arms</b>,
<b>The Queen’s Arms</b>, <b>The Freemasons’ Arms</b>,
<b>The Coachmakers’ Arms</b>, <b>The Saddlers’ Arms</b>,
<b>The Carpenters’ Arms</b>, &amp;c., nowadays identified
by name only, instead of their distinctive badge or
crest. We must not omit to mention also that,
since the especial function of tavern and other signs
was to call attention to the character of an establishment
in days when the people were unable
to read, and when, therefore, the display of the
owner’s name or of the name of the house
would have been useless, the misapprehension
of the painted device was of common occurrence.
Hence the corruption of many signs from their
original meaning.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most glaring instance of this kind
originated in the sign of <b>The Garter</b>, or the insignia
of the Order of the Garter represented in its proper
position on a leg (whence we have the intelligible
sign of <b>The Star and Garter</b>); yet the vulgar
mind quite failed to grasp the idea, with a result
that a house exhibiting this sign was invariably
referred to as <b>The Leg and Star</b>. Corruptions
of a different character are of later date, when the
name of the house instead of the device began to
make its appearance on an innkeeper’s signboard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Chief among these are:&mdash;<b>The Cat and Fiddle</b>, a
perversion of “Caton le Fidele,” in honour of Caton,
the faithful Governor of Calais; <b>The Bag o’ Nails</b>,
of “The Bacchanals,” in reference to Pan and the
Satyrs; <b>The Goat and Compasses</b>, of the Puritan
motto “God encompass us”; <b>The Iron Devil</b>, of
“The Hirondelle,” or swallow; <b>The Bull and
Mouth</b>, and <b>The Bull and Gate</b>, of “The
Boulogne Mouth” and “The Boulogne Gate,” in
compliment to Henry VIII., who effected the siege
of Boulogne and its harbour in 1544; <b>The Lion and
Key</b>, of “The Lion on the Quay,” meaning a house
bearing the sign of <i>The Lion</i>, and situated by the
water-side, in order to distinguish it from other
<i>Lions</i> in the same port; <b>The Cat and Wheel</b>, of
“The Catherine Wheel,” the instrument of St.
Catherine’s martyrdom; <b>The Plume and Feathers</b>,
of “The Plume of Feathers,” in allusion to the
Prince of Wales; <b>The Bully Ruffian</b>, of “The
Bellerophon,” the vessel on board of which Napoleon
surrendered his sword to Captain Maitland after his
defeat at Waterloo; and <b>The Blue Pig</b>, a mere
modification of “The Blue Boar.” <b>The Pig and
Whistle</b> is a very old sign, the term <i>whistle</i> being a
corruption of “wassail,” and <i>pig</i>, the Old English for
a bowl or cup. Surely there could be no more
fitting sign for a tavern than that which suggested
the drinking of healths!</p>

<p>The original character of many of our country
inns is at once indicated by their signs. Thus,
<b>The Coach and Horses</b> was clearly, before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
introduction of railways, a coaching establishment;
while <b>The Pack Horse</b> announced the fact that
pack-horses were let out on hire. Again, <b>The Bear</b>&mdash;subject
to sundry modifications, such as <b>The
Brown Bear</b>, <b>The Black Bear</b>, <b>The Grizzly
Bear</b>&mdash;informed the frequenters of such resorts that
bear-baiting might be witnessed on the premises;
exactly as, nearer to our own day, <b>The Dog and
Duck</b> called attention to the popular diversion of
duck-hunting by spaniels in a pond. <b>The Skittles</b>
and <b>The Bowling Green</b> indicated a more rational
kind of sport. Once more, <b>The Grapes</b> conveyed
the intelligence that a vinery existed in connection
with the establishment; whereas <b>The Castle</b>, which
constitutes the arms of Spain, <b>The Globe</b>, the arms
of the King of Portugal, and <b>The Spread Eagle</b>,
the arms of Germany, told that the wines of those
respective countries were to be had there. In the
north of England the sign of <b>The Yorkshire Stingo</b>
is very common, the allusion being to an old beer
of particular strength and sharpness for which the
county of York has won considerable celebrity.</p>

<p>Among other familiar country inn and tavern signs
may be mentioned <b>The Bell</b>, referring to the silver
bell that formed the prize at races previous to the
Restoration; <b>The Barley Mow</b>, denoting the
premises where the barley was housed, <i>mowe</i> being
the Saxon term for “a heap”; and <b>The Old Hat</b>,
which in the olden time may have been the shop of
a hatter rejoicing in the sign of “The Hat,” and subsequently
converted into a place of refreshment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Another distinctly tradesmanlike sign is <b>The Ram
and Teazle</b>, which was originally chosen in compliment
to the Clothiers’ Company; the lamb with
the golden fleece being emblematical of wool, and
the teazle, a tool used for raising the nap of the
wool when woven into cloth. <b>The Bricklayers’
Arms</b> merely indicate a house of call for bricklayers;
while <b>The Cricketers’ Arms</b> derives its
title from a neighbouring cricket-ground. The significance
of <b>The Tankard</b>, <b>The Bottle</b>, and similar
signs, need not detain us. We may, however, state
that <b>The Black Jack</b> refers to a leathern pitcher
for holding beer, which took its name from the
defensive breastplate of strong leather formerly
worn by horsemen, and known as a <i>Jacque</i>, whence
the term <span class="smcap">Jacket</span> has been derived.</p>

<p>Signs that betray a political bias, such as <b>The
Royal Oak</b>, <b>The Boscobel</b>, <b>The Jacobite</b>, <b>The
Hanover</b>, &amp;c., are altogether too numerous to
mention. In the early part of the present century,
too, the names of political leaders were largely drawn
upon as an attraction for tavern signs, as were those
also of distinguished naval and military commanders,
and of the battles won by them. <b>The
Canning</b>, <b>The Palmerston</b>, <b>The Nelson</b>, <b>The
Wellington</b>, <b>The Marquis of Granby</b>, <b>The
Portobello Arms</b>, <b>The Trafalgar</b>, <b>The Waterloo</b>,
and a host of others of the like character, are
everywhere to be encountered; while the old sign
of <b>The Ship</b> carries us back to the days of Elizabeth,
when the circumnavigation of the globe by Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Francis Drake was regarded as an exploit that
could scarcely be too highly honoured.</p>

<p>Before concluding, let us add a few words of comment
upon the signal loyalty of the English people
in the times we live in; for whereas our forefathers
were for the most part content to express their
loyalty to the throne by the choice of such vague
tavern signs as <b>The King’s Head</b>, or <b>The Queen’s
Head</b>, we of the nineteenth century are not nearly
so half-hearted. Not only are <b>The Victoria</b>, <b>The
Prince Albert</b>, <b>The Prince of Wales</b>, and <b>The
Prince of Wales’ Feathers</b> honoured on every
hand in the course of a day’s perambulation, but
<b>The Duke of Edinburgh</b>, <b>The Duke of Cambridge</b>,
<b>The Duke of Connaught</b>, and other
members of the Royal Family, are similarly memorialized.
Perhaps in the future, when the Prince
of Wales shall occupy the British Throne, his
descendants may also in their turn form the subject
of many a tavern sign in our midst.</p>

<h2 id="ROYAL_SURNAMES"><i>ROYAL SURNAMES.</i></h2>

<p><b>Alfred the Great</b> (reigned 871 to 901)
fully merited his surname because he expelled
the Danes, established a navy, founded
schools, and effected the restoration of law and
order during one of the most critical periods of
early British history. Taking the remainder of
the Saxon monarchs in chronological order, we
have:&mdash;<b>Edward the Martyr</b> (975 to 978),
treacherously murdered at Corfe Castle; <b>Ethelred
the Unready</b> (978 to 1016), who, lacking <i>rede</i>, or
council, fled to Normandy to escape the consequences
of a threatened invasion by the Danes;
<b>Edmund Ironsides</b> (reigned 1016), whose habitual
precaution of wearing a complete suit of mail
availed him nothing against the fatality of assassination;
<b>Edgar Atheling</b> (born 1017, died 1120),
otherwise “Edgar of Royal Descent”; <b>Harold
Harefoot</b> (1035 to 1039), swift of foot as a hare;
and <b>Edward the Confessor</b> (1042 to 1066), so
called on account of his holy life. The distinction
between a <span class="smcap">Confessor</span> and a <span class="smcap">Martyr</span> in the early
days of Christianity was simply this: both made an
open confession of their faith, and expressed their
readiness to die for it; the former, however, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
never called upon to do so, whereas the latter
actually suffered martyrdom.</p>

<p>William I. (reigned 1066 to 1087), was styled
<b>The Conqueror</b> because he defeated the Saxons at
the Battle of Hastings, and founded the Norman
Dynasty in England. William II. (1087 to 1100),
received the name of <b>Rufus</b> from his florid complexion;
<i>rufus</i> being Latin for ruddy. Henry I.
(1100 to 1135), was surnamed <b>Beauclerc</b>, or good
clerk, in recognition of his scholarly attainments.
Richard I. (1189 to 1199), styled <b>Cœur de Leon</b>,
otherwise “The Lion Hearted,” is traditionally said
to have torn the living heart out of the mouth of a
lion to whose fury he was exposed by the Duke of
Austria for having killed his son in battle. This
extraordinary exploit surpasses the bounds of reason;
still there is no doubt that he performed prodigies of
valour during the Wars of the Crusades. Another
British monarch who rejoiced in a surname of the
leonine order was <b>William the Lion</b>, King of the
Scots (1165 to 1214), so called because he chose a
red lion rampant for his crest. It is from this king
that the lions distinguished in the Royal Arms of
Scotland trace their origin.</p>

<p>King John (reigned 1199 to 1216) received the
surname of <b>Lackland</b> on account of his improvidence,
which at the time of the death of his father
(Henry II.) left him entirely without provision.
Edward I. (1272 to 1307) was styled <b>Longshanks</b>
from his spindle legs. The eldest son of Edward
III., known as <b>The Black Prince</b> (born 1330, died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
1376), was not exclusively addicted to the wearing
of black armour, as he is usually represented in
waxwork shows and picture toy-books; consequently
he did not derive his surname from such an association;
but, as the historian Froissart informs us, “he
received his name by terror of his arms.” Seeing
that at the age of sixteen he won his knightly spurs
at Crecy, and ten years later took the French king
prisoner at Poictiers and brought him in triumph to
London, the military renown of this young warrior
must have been sufficient to command respect from
his enemies. <b>John of Gaunt</b>, Duke of Lancaster
(born 1340, died 1399), took his title from the town
of Ghent, in Flanders, where he was born. In like
manner his son, Henry IV. (1399 to 1413), was styled
<b>Bolingbroke</b>, after his native place.</p>

<p>Henry VIII. (reigned 1509 to 1547) was surnamed
<b>Bluff King Hal</b> on account of his bluff manners;
he also received the title of <b>Defender of the Faith</b>
from Pope Leo X., in recognition of the tract he
published against the heresy of Martin Luther. Mary,
Queen of Scots (born 1542, died 1587), was known
as <b>The White Queen</b> because she adopted white
mourning for her husband, Lord Darnley. Our own
Queen Mary (1547 to 1558) has been handed down
to posterity under the opprobrious title of <b>Bloody
Mary</b>, in consequence of the wholesale burnings of
the Protestants under her reign. The religious persecutions
of her time admit of no denial, yet they were
fully equalled by those brought to light during the
reign of her successor, Elizabeth, while they fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
infinitely short of those characterized by the reign
of Henry VIII. In one sense Elizabeth (1558 to
1603) was appropriately styled <b>Good Queen Bess</b>,
inasmuch as she exercised due regard to the interests
of the realm and the welfare of her people. Her
enemies she speedily removed, but she was just as
ready to bestow honours and rewards upon her
nation’s worthies. Oliver Cromwell was called <b>The
Lord Protector</b> (born 1599, died 1658) because he
protected the interests of the Commonwealth. The
reason why Charles II. (1660 to 1685) was dubbed
<b>The Merry Monarch</b> must be sought in the licentiousness
of the times in which he lived. Much
nearer to our own day, William IV. (1830 to 1837)
was distinguished by the title of <b>The Sailor King</b>,
from the circumstance of his having entered the navy
as a midshipman and worked his way upwards until
he attained the rank of Lord High Admiral.</p>

<p>The family name of <b>Plantagenet</b>, derived from
the Latin <i>planta</i>, a plant, and <i>genista</i>, broom, was
originally assumed by Fulke Martel, Earl of Anjou,
the great grandfather of Henry II., in commemoration
of the incident, while on his pilgrimage to the
Holy Sepulchre, of having offered himself to be
scourged with the stems of the broom plant by his
two attendants as an atonement for the murder of
the Earl of Brittany. The <b>Tudor</b> Dynasty was
founded by Owen Tudor, a Welsh soldier stationed
at Windsor, who contracted a secret marriage with
Catherine, the widowed queen of Henry V. The
first of the long line of the <b>Stuart</b> sovereigns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
(Scottish and English) was Walter, the Lord High
Steward of Scotland, whose wife was the daughter
of King Robert the Bruce. As this Walter was the
sixth member of his family that had held the post of
Lord High Steward, he was popularly said to belong
to the <i>Stewards</i>, until in course of time this word
became corrupted into <i>Stuarts</i>, and was adopted as a
family name.</p>

<p>Charles I., Emperor of Germany (born 742, died
814), was surnamed <b>Charlemagne</b>, otherwise
Charles the Great. <b>The She-Wolf of France</b>
was Isabella (born 1290, died 1357), daughter of
Philip IV. of France, and queen of Edward II. of
England, whom she, in concert with the Earl of
Mortimer, her paramour, murdered by thrusting a
red-hot iron into his bowels. <b>Pedro the Cruel</b>,
King of Castille and Leon in 1350, merited his surname
owing to his cruel treatment of his two
brothers, whom he murdered, and his queen, whom
he poisoned. Ivan II., Czar of Russia (reigned
1533 to 1584), was styled <b>The Terrible</b> on account
of the cruelties he inflicted upon all who offended his
autocracy. Frederick I., of Germany (reigned 1152
to 1190), was surnamed <b>Barbarossa</b> from his red
beard, <i>barba</i> being Latin for beard; while for his
bombardment of Messina in 1848 Ferdinand, King
of Naples, was nicknamed <b>Bomba</b>. Philippe, Duc
d’Orleans, the father of Louis Philippe, King of
France, assumed the name of <b>Egalité</b> when he
joined the Republican party in 1789. Of a truth,
if “Equality” was what this not unworthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Prince aspired to, he enjoyed it to the full, for
he lost his head under the guillotine in common
with more than twenty thousand of his fellow-citizens.</p>

<h2 id="NATIONAL_NICKNAMES"><i>NATIONAL NICKNAMES.</i></h2>

<p><b>Brother Jonathan</b>, the popular nickname
of the United States, arose out of the
person of Jonathan Trumbull, the Governor
of Connecticut, whom General Washington never
failed to consult in cases of emergency. “We must
refer the matter to Brother Jonathan!” he was
wont to exclaim when no other officer could offer
any practical suggestion to aid him out of a difficulty;
and true enough, “Brother Jonathan” proved
himself in every instance equal to the confidence
reposed in him. Another stock nickname for the
United States is <b>Uncle Sam</b>. This originated from
a vulgar misconception of the initial letters “U. S.”
(United States) for those of the well-known sobriquet
of an official whose business it was to mark
them on all Government property. The numerous
acquaintances of this person understood that the
goods so marked had passed through the hands of
“Uncle Sam,” and the joke becoming public it spread
far and wide, until in the end it was considered far
too good to be allowed to drop. The term <b>Yankee</b>
finds its origin in the native attempt to pronounce
the word “English,” but approaching no nearer
to the sound than <i>Yengees</i>, the name bestowed upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the English colonists by the Indians of Massachusetts,
and afterwards given to the New Englanders
by the British soldiers during the American War.</p>

<p>The nickname of the typical Englishman, <b>John
Bull</b>, was derived from Dr. Arbuthnot’s satire of
this title published in 1721. There was also a real
person of the name of John Bull, well known as the
composer of “God Save the King”; but he died
just a hundred years before Dr. Arbuthnot’s performance
was heard of. Of a still later date is the
national English nickname, <b>Mrs. Grundy</b>, which
arose out of the passage, “What will Mrs. Grundy
say?” from Thomas Morton’s drama, “Speed the
Plough,” produced in 1798. The proverbial prudishness
of the English people in matters affecting art,
could scarcely be better expressed than under the
style of <b>The British Matron</b>. The British soldier
is popularly referred to under the general designation
of <b>Tommy Atkins</b>, because “Thomas Atkins”
was a fictitious name that figured in the soldiers’
monthly statement of accounts.</p>

<p>The Irish as a nation are invariably alluded to as
<b>Pat</b> or <b>Paddy</b>, being short for Patrick, their most
common Christian name, selected in honour of St.
Padhrig, or Patrick (born 373, died 466); the Scots
as <b>Sandie</b> or <b>Sawney</b>, a contraction of Alexander,
their most popular Christian name; and the Welsh
as <b>Taffy</b>, a corruption of Davy, and short for David,
the name of their Archbishop and Saint (born 490,
died 554).</p>

<p>The national nickname of the Chinese is <b>John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Chinaman</b>, in imitation of our own characteristic
“John Bull.” Even now a Chinaman addresses
every Englishman he meets as “John,” which is his
idea of our most popular name. Hence, British
sailors in the Chinese waters from the first returned
the compliment, so to speak, by alluding to each
Celestial with whom they came in contact as “John
Chinaman.”</p>

<p>The Chinese are also called <b>Pigtails</b>, on account
of their Tartar tonsure and braided <i>queue</i>. By the
Indians of North America Europeans are styled
<b>Pale Faces</b>; while the Europeans designate the
Indians <b>Red Skins</b>, both terms having reference to
the complexion. The word <b>Nigger</b> is a corruption
of <b>Negro</b>, derived from <i>niger</i>, the Latin for black.
The reason why a negro generally bears the name of
<b>Sambo</b> is because <i>Zambo</i> is the native term used to
designate the offspring of a black person and a
mulatto. The word <b>Mulatto</b> is Spanish, derived
from the Latin <i>mulus</i>, a mule, and signifying a mixed
breed. A Mulatto may be either the offspring of a
negress by a white man, or of a white woman by a
negro.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="BIRDS"><i>BIRDS.</i></h2>

<p>The following owe their names to their characteristic
note:&mdash;the <b>Cuck-oo</b>, the <b>Pee-wit</b>,
the <b>Cur-lew</b>, the <b>Chick-a-dee</b>, and the
<b>Whip-poor-will</b>. The <b>Trumpeter</b> of South
America is so called on account of its loud, clear,
and trumpet-like cry. The word <b>Nightingale</b> is a
modern form of the Anglo-Saxon <i>nihtegale</i>, indicative
of a bird that sings by night, agreeably to its
component parts, <i>niht</i>, night, and <i>gale</i>, a songster.
The <b>Night-Jar</b> bears its name because the sound it
emits resembles the whirring of a spinning-wheel.
The <b>Mocking-bird</b> possesses the power of imitating
the notes of other birds; while the <b>Humming-bird</b>
is remarkable for the humming sound that proceeds
from its wings as it speeds through the air.</p>

<p>Several birds are named after the colour or some
other characteristic of their plumage. Among these
we have the <b>Greenfinch</b> and the <b>Goldfinch</b>, the
term <b>Finch</b> from the Anglo-Saxon <i>finc</i>, denoting
a small singing bird; the <b>Greenlet</b> expressing
a tiny green bird peculiar to South America;
the <b>Jay</b>, a corruption of <i>gai</i>, its French name,
alluding to its gay or showy appearance; the
<b>Blue-bird</b>, common in the United States, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
upper half of which is blue; the <b>Blackbird</b>, so
called from its sable aspect; the <b>Starling</b>, owing to
the specks at the extremities of its feathers; the
<b>Flamingo</b>, of South America and Africa, from its
flaming colour; the <b>Oriole</b>, an Australian bird of
golden-yellow plumage, agreeably to the Latin
<i>aureolus</i>, golden; and the <b>Lyre-bird</b>, also a native
of Australia, so denominated on account of the sixteen
feathers of the tail which when folded form in
appearance a perfect lyre. The British song-bird
known as the <b>Red-poll</b> receives its name from the
tuft of red feathers upon its head; whereas the South
African <b>Secretary-bird</b> is so called because a tuft
of feathers on each side of its head are supposed to
resemble quill pens stuck behind the ear. The South
American <b>Birds of Paradise</b> are indeed a beautiful
species, all the colours of the rainbow being represented
in their plumage; and the same may be said
of the <b>Love-birds</b>, so designated from the extraordinary
affection which they exhibit towards one
another. The <b>Kingfisher</b> is regarded as the king
of fisher-birds, or those that dive for fish as their
prey, by reason of his gay plumage.</p>

<p>The <b>Lapwing</b> derives its name from the loud
flapping noise made by its wings during flight; the
<b>Wagtail</b>, from the incessant wagging of its tail; and
the <b>Scissors-tail</b>&mdash;found only in South America&mdash;from
the peculiar nature of its tail, which, like a pair
of scissors, opens and shuts in the course of its rapid
passage through the air and so entraps the flies upon
which it preys. The <b>Hangbird</b> is so called from its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
habit of suspending its nest from the limb of a tree;
the <b>Weaver-bird</b>, from the wonderful intertwining
of twigs and grass displayed in the construction of
its nest; and the <b>Tailor-bird</b>, from the skill it displays
in constructing its nest by stitching together
the leaves of plants.</p>

<p>Among corruptions of the names of birds it will be
sufficient to mention the <b>Widow-bird</b>, properly the
<i>Whydaw-bird</i>, after the territory in Africa of which
it is a native; the <b>Martin</b>, from the Latin <i>murustenco</i>,
or wall-swallow, shortened into <i>murten</i>, and
mispronounced <i>marten</i>; and the <b>Muscovy Duck</b>,
which, so far from claiming a Muscovite origin, is
merely a <i>musk duck</i>, a species somewhat larger than
our common duck.</p>

<p>The <b>Swift</b> derives its name from its rapid flight;
the <b>Passenger-pigeon</b>, from its migratory habits;
the <b>Skylark</b>, from mounting to the sky and singing
as it flies; and the <b>Chaffinch</b>, from its preference for
chaff above every other kind of food. The <b>Diver</b> is
remarkable for its habit of diving; the <b>Sandpiper</b>
inhabits the sea-beach; and the <b>Chimney-swallow</b>
builds his nest in an ordinary house chimney. The
<b>Horn-bill</b>, the <b>Boat-bill</b>, the <b>Spoon-bill</b>, and the
<b>Duck-bill</b> are respectively so named on account of
the resemblance of their bills to the articles, and in
the last-mentioned case to the bird, indicated; while
the <b>Cross-bill</b> has its mandibles crossed in opposite
directions. The <b>Pouter-pigeon</b> is so called from
the pouting, or bulging out, of its breast; the <b>Ring-dove</b>,
from the white ring around its neck; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
<b>Wryneck</b>, from the curious manner in which it
turns its neck over its shoulder when surprised.
The <b>Woodcock</b> is found in the underwood of a
forest, while the <b>Woodpecker</b> pecks holes in the
bark of trees in search for insects.</p>

<p>Chief among the birds which derive their names
from the countries to which they originally belonged
are the <b>Guinea-fowl</b>, brought from Guinea, West
Africa; the <b>Brahma-fowl</b>, from the neighbourhood
of the Brahmapootra River in India; the <b>Bantam</b>,
from Bantam in Java; the <b>Barb</b>, from Barbary, and
the <b>Turkey</b>, which, although an American bird, was
long believed to have been imported from European
Turkey. Another native of North America received
its name of the <b>Baltimore-bird</b> from the fact that
its colours corresponded with those which occurred
in the arms of Lord Baltimore, the Governor of
Maryland, in which State it principally abounds.
The <b>Canary</b> was first brought from the Canary
Islands in 1500. The <b>Petrel</b>, a sea-bird usually
associated with storms, expresses the Anglicized
form of the Italian <i>petrillo</i>, a diminutive of Peter, in
allusion to St. Peter walking on the sea, and the
frequent appearance of this bird standing as it were
on the surface of the water.</p>

<h2 id="RELIGIOUS_ORDERS"><i>RELIGIOUS ORDERS.</i></h2>

<p>Strictly speaking, the members of the various
Religious Orders, in this country at least, are
not <b>Monks</b>, but Friars. Only those who live
completely isolated from the rest of mankind, as
did St. Anthony, are entitled to the former designation,
which, in common with the term <b>Monastery</b>,
comes from the Greek <i>monos</i>, alone. Consequently,
a Religious House is incorrectly described as a
Monastery unless each individual within its walls
occupies a separate cell, both by night and by day,
and never suffers himself to have the least communion
with his neighbour. Failing compliance with
such a rule, the term <b>Convent</b>, derived from the
Latin <i>con</i>, together, and <i>venire</i>, to come, is more
fittingly applicable. This designation, however, is
now borne by an institution reserved for a community
of <b>Nuns</b>, so called from the Italian <i>nonna</i>, a
grandmother, because they originally comprised only
very aged women; albeit it was formerly the custom
to speak of Monasteries and Convents without discrimination.
An <b>Abbey</b> always indicated a Religious
House in connection with a Church, as, for example,
Westminster Abbey, the abode of the community
attached to the West Minster, presided over by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
an <b>Abbot</b>, so styled in accordance with the Syriac
and Latin <i>abba</i>, a father, or, in the case of a female
community, by an <b>Abbess</b>; whereas a <b>Priory</b>
denoted a lesser or branch establishment placed at
some distance from the Abbey, and controlled by a
<b>Prior</b> (or <b>Prioress</b>), signifying one who had a prior
claim over the rest to the office of Abbot (or Abbess)
in the original community.</p>

<p>A <b>Friar</b>, on the other hand, is&mdash;conformably to
the Latin <i>fratre</i> and the French <i>frère</i>, a brother&mdash;what
the term implies, viz., one of a brotherhood.
In olden times there existed four distinct and powerful
Orders of Friars. These were the <b>Dominicans</b>,
founded by St. Dominic to preach away the Albigensian
heresies, also known as the <b>Black Friars</b>,
on account of their black habits, and in France as
the <b>Jacobins</b>, because their first convent was
situated in the Rue St. Jacques, Paris; the <b>Franciscans</b>,
or <b>Grey Friars</b>, named after St. Francis
d’Assissi; the <b>Carmelites</b>, or <b>White Friars</b> of
Mount Carmel; and the <b>Augustines</b>, or <b>Austin
Friars</b>, whose origin is ascribed to St. Augustin
or Austin, the first Archbishop of Canterbury, who
died in 605. Eventually a fifth Order, styled the
<b>Trinitarians</b>, or Friars of the Holy Trinity, otherwise
the <b>Crutched Friars</b>, so called from the cross
(Latin <i>cruciati</i>, crossed) embroidered on their habit,
came into existence.</p>

<p>Referring to the Franciscans, those who conformed
to the austere rules laid down by their
founder were denominated <b>Observant Friars</b>, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
those who, as time wore on, began to live in convents
and coveted lands, chapels, and books, received the
name of <b>Conventional Friars</b>. Out of the Franciscans
there have sprung two lesser Orders, so to
speak, chiefly distinguished by a slight change in
the details appertaining to the habit worn by them.
These are the <b>Capuchins</b>, so called from the <i>capuce</i>,
or pointed cowl, that they wear, and the <b>Cordeliers</b>,
from the knotted cord which encircles their waist in
place of a girdle. In effect, however, these two
offshoots of the Franciscans are the same, and
subject to the like rules, as the parent institution.</p>

<p>Having disposed of the Friars, let us now turn to
the Monks properly so called. Originally the sole
existing order of monks was that of the <b>Benedictines</b>
as established by St. Benedict, who introduced
the monastic system into Western Europe in
the year 529. No less than twelve large Monasteries
were raised by him before he died; but notwithstanding
the austere rules which obtained among
the Benedictines, these were yet considered too lax
by some individual members of the Order, with the
result that first one and then another “Reformed
Order” sprang into existence, the latest being in
each case distinguished for a still more rigorous
rule than that of its immediate predecessor. Thus,
we now have the <b>Carthusians</b>, our English designation
for the monks of La Chartreuse near Grenoble,
by whom the celebrated liqueur known as
<b>Chartreuse</b> is prepared; the <b>Cistercians</b>, or monks
of Citeau; and the <b>Cluniacs</b>, or monks of Cluny,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
respectively named after the vicinity of their original
monastery in France; while the <b>Bernardines</b> received
their title from St. Bernard, who founded the
famous Hospice of Mont St. Bernard in the year
962. From the Carthusians, also, there have sprung
the <b>Basilians</b> founded by St. Basil, and from the
Cistercians, the <b>Trappists</b>, or monks of La Trappe,
originally established in the French district so denominated.</p>

<p>Foremost among the Religious Orders not comprised
in any of the brotherhoods cited above are
the <b>Jesuists</b>, properly styled “The Society of Jesus,”
an organization founded upon a military basis by St.
Ignatius Loyola in 1534, which extends its influence
all over the globe. Next in point of importance
come the <b>Servites</b>, otherwise “The Religious Servants
of the Holy Virgin,” established by seven
Florentine merchants in 1283; the <b>Passionists</b>, a
community of priests solemnly agreed to preach
“Jesus Christ and Him crucified,” founded by Paul
Francis, better known as St. Paul of the Cross, in
1737; and the <b>Redemptorists</b>, or preachers of the
Redemption, also styled the <b>Liguorians</b>, after St.
Francis Liguori, who originated this Order in 1732.
Each of these, except, of course, the lay members
of the Jesuists, are professedly Monks; and yet these
are not really Monks, but <i>Friars</i>, because they live
in community, and at times mingle freely with the
people. In short, they are <b>Missionary Friars</b>.</p>

<h2 id="PAPER_AND_PRINTING"><i>PAPER AND PRINTING.</i></h2>

<p>The word <b>Paper</b> comes from the Latin <i>papyrus</i>,
and Greek <i>papyros</i>, the designation of an
Egyptian plant from whose reeds the earliest
kind of writing material was obtained. <b>Parchment</b>
is an Anglicized form of the French <i>parchemin</i>,
from the Greek <i>pergamenos</i>, named after the ancient
city of Pergamos, in Asia Minor, where the skins of
goats were first prepared for writing upon at a time
when Ptolemy prohibited the exportation of the
papyrus from Egypt.</p>

<p><b>Hand-paper</b> was originally so called from its
watermark, which was that of a hand; <b>Pot-Paper</b>,
of a pot; <b>Post-paper</b>, of a post-horn; <b>Crown-paper</b>,
of a crown; and <b>Foolscap</b>, of a fool’s head with the
cap and bells. <b>India-paper</b> formerly came from
the Far East, whereas <b>Nepaul-paper</b> is made in
the district of Nepaul, Northern India. <b>Cap-paper</b>
is so designated because, prior to being used by
grocers for wrapping up sugar and other commodities
sold by weight, it is folded into a cap-like
form. Among papers of a stiffer kind, that are
chiefly intended for drawing upon, we have <b>Elephant</b>,
so called from its large size (28 inches by
23), <b>Cartridge-paper</b>, originally manufactured for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
soldiers’ cartridges, and <b>Bristol-board</b>, formerly
made only at Bristol.</p>

<p>By the term <b>Folio</b>, derived from the Latin <i>folium</i>,
a leaf, is meant a sheet of paper folded but once,
thus making two leaves or four pages; a <b>Quarto</b>
(written 4to), is a sheet folded into quarters or four
leaves, making eight pages; an <b>Octavo</b> (8vo), so
styled in accordance with the Latin <i>octa</i>, eight, one
folded into eight leaves or sixteen pages; a <b>Duodecimo</b>
(12mo), the Latin for “two and ten,” one
making twelve leaves or twenty-four pages, and so
forth.</p>

<p>When Caxton set up the first printing press in
this country, in the year 1476, there were many
among the vulgar who regarded it as an invention
of the devil; and the clergy, no doubt, fostered this
idea, foreseeing that in the event of the Bible being
distributed to the masses by this means, the way
would be thrown open to the production of spurious
editions of Sacred Writ, and the perversion of religious
doctrine, which up to that period had been free
to all who chose to attend daily instruction in the
monasteries. Hence, printing was popularly described
as “The Black Art,” while the boys who
took the sheets off the press, from the fact of generally
smearing their faces with ink, came to be
known as Imps or Devils. This will explain why a
printer’s errand-boy still bears the nickname of a
<b>Printer’s Devil</b>.</p>

<p>Our Parliamentary Records, Debates, Reports of
Meetings, and Accounts, have received the name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
<b>Hansards</b> because they are printed by the large
printing firm established by Luke Hansard in 1752;
whereas a <b>Blue Book</b> is so called on account of
its stiff cover of blue paper. The French Government
reports are styled <b>Yellow Books</b> for a similar
reason. The term <b>Book</b> comes from the Danish
<i>bog</i>, a beech-tree, which abounds in Denmark and
whose wood is much used for engraving-blocks.
The <b>Leaf</b> of a book is in allusion to the ancient
custom of writing on the bark of trees; while
<b>Volume</b> is derived from the Latin <i>volvo</i>, I roll,
relative to the Egyptian papyri, each one of which
when rolled up formed a document or volume complete
in itself. A storehouse for books is styled a
<b>Library</b>, in accordance with the Latin <i>librarium</i>, a
book-case, derived in the first instance from <i>liber</i>, a
book.</p>

<p>A <b>Pamphlet</b> owes its description to Pamphila, a
Greek lady who left behind her a kind of commonplace
book containing notes, epitomes, and anecdotes.
The French equivalent for a pamphlet is a
<b>Brochure</b>, so called from the verb <i>brocher</i>, to stitch,
because such a book consists only of a few pages
stitched together. The word <b>Chart</b> comes from the
Latin <i>charta</i>, a leaf of paper; a chart, therefore, is
not printed on canvas like a map, but on a single
sheet of paper. <b>Map</b> traces its origin from <i>mappa</i>,
a Punic word which signified a signal-cloth, also a
napkin, because in ancient times military and other
landmarks were sketched upon a cloth in the absence
of parchment and paper. Nowadays, a book of maps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
designed for school use is called an <b>Atlas</b>, after
the fabled King of Mauritania of this name,
who was believed by the ancients to support the
world on his shoulders. The figure of Atlas with
the globe first appeared as a frontispiece to
“Mercator’s Projections,” published about the year
1560.</p>

<p>A <b>Cartoon</b>, as we understand the term, is a representation
of political significance, usually coloured
and printed on stiff paper. To some extent this
kind of publication owes its origin to the celebrated
‘Cartoons’ of Raffaelle, now in the South Kensington
Museum, so called because they were drawn
upon <i>cartone</i>, the Italian for pasteboard. A <b>Broadside</b>
consists of a large sheet of paper having the
matter printed straight across, instead of in columns,
so as to admit of being read at one broad view. The
reverse side of the sheet is left blank. A <b>Poster</b>
bears its name from the fact that formerly the sidewalks
of London streets, instead of being paved as
now, were distinguished from the centre, or sedan-chair
and riding way, by a series of posts; and upon
these, theatrical and other announcements were
<i>posted</i>. In France, the theatre bills are exhibited
upon the lamp-posts on the Boulevards in a similar
manner. In conclusion, the distinction between <span class="smcap">Booksellers</span>
and <span class="smcap">Stationers</span> was originally this: the
former were itinerant sellers of books, like hawkers,
and pedlars, whereas the latter had stalls at the
corners of streets or in open market; and as the
<i>stationarii</i>, or stationary booksellers, were enabled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
display a more varied stock than the itinerants who
carried books only, such articles as writing-paper,
pens, ink, and other materials in course of time received
the name of <b>Stationery</b>.</p>

<h2 id="POLITICAL_NICKNAMES"><i>POLITICAL NICKNAMES.</i></h2>

<p>The utmost difficulty exists in reconciling the
various opinions expressed by different authors
concerning the origin of the terms <b>Whig</b> and
<b>Tory</b>. And yet, if we but consider the reasons why
these nicknames were first bestowed upon the two
great political factions of this country during the
reign of Charles II., we may possibly attain a
much-desired end. In the year 1648 (<i>temp.</i> Charles
I.) there occurred a rising, or sally, of the peasantry
inhabiting the south-western districts of Scotland
against the Royalists. This was known as the
<b>Whigamore Raid</b>, the term <i>whigamore</i> being
applied to the teamsters and ploughmen of those
parts because they used the twin-syllabic cry of
“Whi-gam!” to drive their horses. When,
therefore, in the early days of the Restoration, the
ultra-Protestant party opposed certain measures of
the Government, the Catholics reproached them
with favouring the fanatical opinions of the Scottish
Covenanters and Whigamores, and styled them
<b>Whigs</b>. In return the Protestants bestowed upon
their opponents the nickname of <b>Tories</b>, the
familiar designation of a band of Irish outlaws
who sought refuge in the bog districts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Ireland. The word Tory, or rather <i>Toree</i>, is Irish,
signifying a robber. From that time down to the
present <b>Toryism</b> has been considered to denote a
steadfast adherence to constitutional principles and
the maintenance of royalty and the peerage, as
opposed to the progressive and more <i>liberal</i> views
appertaining to <b>Whiggism</b>, which advocates constitutional
reform and a moderate extension of
democratical powers. The word <b>Liberal</b> was first
employed by Lord Byron and his friends as the
title of a periodical intended to set forth the political
aims of the advanced Whig party in 1828. The
term <b>Conservative</b> (derived from the Latin <i>con</i>,
together, and <i>servare</i>, to keep, to preserve) first
appeared in an article in <i>The Quarterly Review</i>,
January, 1830, and was permanently adopted by
the Tory party on the passing of the Reform Bill
two years afterwards. The still more advanced
section of the Whig party which came into prominence
in 1816 were styled <b>Radicals</b>, or <b>Radical
Reformers</b>, from their desire to institute a <i>thorough</i>
reformation in the national policy. In our own day
the Radicals and the Democrats may be set down
as one and the same party; while the <b>Socialists</b>
eminently carry out the principles of the primitive
Radicals of the time of Charles I., who styled
themselves <b>Levellers</b> because they strove to reduce
society to a common level. The word <b>Democrat</b> is
derived from the Greek <i>demos</i>, people, and <i>kratein</i>, to
govern; therefore denoting one who upholds the
principle of government by the people themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and diametrically opposed to an <b>Aristocracy</b> (Greek,
<i>aristos</i>, best, and <i>kratein</i>, to govern), or government
by the bravest and best. These terms were first
brought into notice by the French Revolutionists
of 1790.</p>

<p>Adverting to the protracted struggle between the
<b>Royalists</b> under Charles I. and the <b>Parliamentarians</b>
under the Cromwellian Parliament, no two
nicknames could have been more suggestive of their
origin than those respectively of the <b>Cavaliers</b> and
the <b>Roundheads</b>. The latter arose out of the
Puritan fashion of cropping the hair close round
the head, the former from the cavalier manner in
which a number of gentlemen offered themselves as
a permanent escort to the King after he had been
subjected to insult in December, 1641. The word
Cavalier is synonymous with the French <i>chevalier</i>,
a mounted knight, from <i>cheval</i>, a horse, derived from
the Latin <i>caballus</i>, and the Greek <i>kaballes</i>, an inferior
horse.</p>

<p>The Protestants in Ireland received the name of
<b>Orangemen</b> owing to their adherence to William
III., Prince of Orange, while the Roman Catholics
were styled <b>Jacobites</b> from their adhesion to James
II., <i>Jacobus</i> being the Latin form of the King’s
name. The <b>Peep o’ Day Boys</b> were so called
because they broke into the houses of the people at
dawn of day in quest of arms; and the <b>White Boys</b>,
from the white smocks they wore over their clothing.
The depredations of both these insurgents were
finally put an end to by the Insurrection Acts, passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
in 1786-7. The secret brotherhood of the <b>Fenians</b>,
organized for the overthrow of the English rule in
Ireland, derived its name from Fiona Mac Cumhal,
better known as Fingal, after whom <span class="smcap">Fingal’s Cave</span>
is designated. The correct interpretation of the
Gaelic word <i>Fenian</i> is “a hunter.” Another secret
society of quite recent origin is that of the <b>Irish
Invincibles</b>, established, as was publicly stated by
Carey the Informer, for the “making of history by
killing tyrants.” Their title is due to the boast
that they defy extermination. The <b>Ribbonmen</b>
take their name from the distinctive badge which
they wear. <b>Emergency Men</b> are the more active
members of the Irish Defence Association. The <b>Separists</b>
and the <b>Parnellites</b> are one and the same,
sworn to support the measures of Mr. Parnell and
the Irish National Party in promoting Home Rule
for Ireland. The now familiar word <b>Boycotting</b>,
in connection with Irish affairs, arose out of the
troubles experienced by Captain Boycott, of Lough
Mask Farm, near Ballinrobe, County Mayo, the
land agent of Lord Erne. His house was besieged,
his labourers were threatened, his crops remained
ungathered, and tradesmen refused to supply him
with goods. This occurred on the 11th and 12th
of November, 1880, after which the military was
despatched to his aid, and a “Boycott Fund”
subscribed for his benefit. The expression “to
boycott” a man practically means to place him
beyond the pale of civilization.</p>

<p>The lowest order of the French Revolutionists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
were denominated <b>Sansculottes</b>, literally, “without
breeches,” because they rejected those very serviceable
articles of attire as being emblematical of the
aristocracy. The same term was also applied to the
Republican leaders as a reproach for the negligence
of their dress; but after a time they themselves
adopted the title with pride. The <b>Red Republicans</b>
were so called for a two-fold reason. In the first
place, they did not hesitate to steep their hands in
human blood to accomplish their political aims;
and, secondly, they wore the red cap, symbolical of
Liberty from the days of the Romans downwards.
The two antagonistic parties of the Revolution were
styled <b>The Mountain</b> and <b>The Plain</b> for the
reason that the former sat upon the most elevated
benches in the Hall of Assembly, while the latter
occupied the ground floor. The Plain was for the
most part composed of the <b>Girondists</b>, or deputies
from the Department of the Gironde.</p>

<p>The <b>Hats</b> and the <b>Caps</b> were the two great
political factions in Sweden, so called on account
of the French <i>chapeaux</i> worn by the partisans of the
French interest on the one side, and the Russian
caps worn by the partisans of the Russian interest
on the other. <i>Apropos</i> of Russia, the word <b>Nihilist</b>
(derived from the Latin <i>nihil</i>, nothing), originally
denoted a social rather than a political party
opposed to the tyranny of custom. Its significance
is well expressed by Turgeneff, who first introduced
it in his novel “Fathers and Sons,” published in
1862:&mdash;“A Nihilist is a man who bows before no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
authority, who accepts no principle without examination,
no matter what credit the principle has.” At
the present day a Nihilist is a revolutionary Socialist
of the most pronounced degree.</p>

<p>The Italian <b>Carbonari</b>, being the plural of
<i>carbonaro</i>, a coal-man, a charcoal-burner, who first
came into notice in 1820, assumed their designation
from the fact of their meetings being originally held in
the huts of the charcoal-burners, and because they
held charcoal to be the symbol of purification. The
<b>Black Cloaks</b> were the upper classes of Naples,
distinguished by the colour and quality of their
cloaks from the <b>Lazzari</b>, or beggars. Regarded as
a political party, the Neapolitan Black Cloaks no
longer exist; but the <b>Lazzaroni</b>, so called from the
Hospital of St. Lazarus, which serves for their
refuge, are still to be met with in all quarters of the
city. Then, again, we must not omit mention of
the <b>Guelphs</b> and the <b>Ghibellines</b>, names of two
powerful families whose rival partisanship of the
Papal and the Imperial supremacy in Italy threatened
the peace of Europe during the long period
embraced between the years 1250 and 1500.</p>

<p>The word <b>Federal</b> comes from the Latin <i>fœdus</i>, a
league or compact. A federal form of government
is one under which a number of States, while retaining
their individual institutions and autonomy, unite
together for purposes of defence and for a larger
national existence, delegating to a representative
national government certain specified powers. The
most noteworthy examples in history of this form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of government are the Achaean League, the Swiss
Republic, and the United States of America. In the
early history of the United States the term “Federal”
was applied to that one of the two great political
parties which was supposed to be more particularly
in sympathy with English standards and to favour
an English alliance, and which desired a strong
central government. Their opponents, who preferred
a French alliance, and who opposed a strong
central government, were then termed “Republicans.”</p>

<p>About 1830 the “Federals” became <b>Whigs</b>, and
in 1856 they assumed the name of <b>Republicans</b>
(from <i>res publica</i>, the State), the States-rights party
having in the meantime taken the name of “Democrats”
(from <i>demos</i>, the people). During the civil
war of 1861-1865 the Northerners were all termed
“Federals” (or by their opponents “Yankees” or
“Yanks”), while the Southerners had taken the
name of <b>Confederates</b>, because their Constitution
instituted a weaker central government and favoured
the independent action of the several States.</p>

<p>The Southerners were also given the nickname of
“Corn-feds,” in allusion to the chief article of their
diet. The term <b>Yankee</b> above alluded to dates
back to the seventeenth century, and is a modification
of the name “Yengees,” an attempt by the
Massachusetts Indians to pronounce the name
“English.”</p>

<p>By the residents of the Northern States, the term
is limited to the inhabitants of the six States of New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
England. During the civil war of 1861-1865, the
members of a political faction in the North received
the name of <b>Copperheads</b>, because they were regarded
as secret foes to the national cause. The
allusion was to the poisonous copperhead serpent,
which gives no warning of its approach. The
<b>Know-nothings</b> were a secret political party in
the United States (1848-1860), whose chief aim was
the checking of foreign immigration and the political
influence of foreigners by the repeal of the Naturalization
Laws, and the reserving of public appointments
for native-born Americans. The answer given by
its members to all questions about the party organization
was, “I don’t know.”</p>

<p>The <b>Tammany Ring</b> was the name used to
designate an organization among certain officials
and their backers in the city of New York in 1870-1871,
who succeeded for a time in enriching themselves
at the expense of the city. The ring was
overthrown in 1871, and its leaders imprisoned or
banished. The name of the ring arose from Tammany
Hall, the headquarters of a society originally
founded (in 1805) for benevolent purposes, but which
had become a political power, and which is again
(1892) controlling the government of New York.</p>

<p>The term <b>Mugwump</b> first came into political use
in 1884. It was then applied to voters who had
been “Republicans,” but who, on various grounds,
preferred the Democratic candidate Cleveland to the
Republican Blaine, and who succeeded in electing
the former. It has since been given generally to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
citizens, who, while actively interested in politics,
refuse to be bound closely by party ties, considering
causes such as free trade, civil service reform, honest
money, &amp;c., as more important than party labels or
party success. The name “Mugwump” is said to be
derived from an Indian word signifying “wise chief.”</p>

<p>The <b>Chartists</b> constituted an enormous body of
the people of this country who, soon after the
passing of the Reform Bill in 1832, loudly clamoured
for “The People’s Charter,” of which the six
principal points were these:&mdash;Universal Suffrage,
Vote by Ballot, Annual Parliaments, Payment of
the Members, Abolition of the Property Qualification,
and the Equalization of Electorial Rights. William
Lovett, the author of this document, died in August,
1877. The English war party, who sided with the
Turks in the Russo-Turkish struggle of 1878 received
the nickname of <b>Jingoes</b>, or <b>The Jingo Party</b>,
from the chorus of Macdermott’s famous music-hall
song, commencing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“We don’t want to fight, but, <i>by Jingo</i>, if we do!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Jingo” is a corruption of <i>Jainko</i>, the Basque term
for God. Hence the expression, “By Jingo!” is
properly a direct appeal to the Deity. A <b>Protectionist</b>
is one who advocates the protection of
home-produce and manufactures against foreign
competition by the imposition of import duties.</p>

<h2 id="FLOWERS"><i>FLOWERS.</i></h2>

<p>The name of <b>Forget-me-not</b> originated in the
following legend:&mdash;A German knight and his lady
were walking on the bank of the Danube, when
the fair one saw a beautiful tuft of <i>Myosotis palustris</i>
growing in the water, and expressed a wish to have
it. With chivalrous alacrity the knight at once
plunged into the river and gathered his prize; but
before he could regain the steep and slippery bank,
encumbered as he was by his heavy armour, he
was drawn by the treacherous eddy into a deep pool.
Finding he could not save himself, he threw the
flowers ashore to his mistress as he sank, and
uttered with his last breath the words “<i>Vergess
mein nicht!</i>” (“Forget-me-not!”) Hence this flower
has come to be universally regarded as the emblem
of fidelity.</p>

<p><b>Mignonette</b>, the diminutive of <i>Mignon</i>, the French
for “darling,” is so called on account of its delicate
fragrance. The <b>Carnation</b> owes its name to the
Latin <i>caro</i>, flesh, in relation to its colour. <b>Geranium</b>
comes from the Greek and Latin <i>geranos</i>, a
crane; this genus of plants having a beak-like torus,
or receptacle. It is also known as <b>Crane’s-bill</b> for
the same reason. <b>Pansy</b> is an Anglicized form of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the French <i>pensée</i>, “thoughts,” this being the sentiment
expressed by the flower.</p>

<p>The <b>Camellia</b> was named after G. J. Camelli,
the German botanist and missionary (died 1690), by
whom it was introduced into Europe from the East;
the <b>Dahlia</b>, after Andrew Dahl, the Swedish botanist,
who discovered it in Mexico in 1784; and the <b>Fuchsia</b>,
after Leonard Fuchs, who brought it from Mexico
about the year 1542. The <b>Victoria Regia</b> was so
called because it was introduced into this country
from British Guiana soon after the accession of
Queen Victoria. The <b>Adonis</b> is said to have
sprung out of the blood of Adonis, the beautiful
youth who was gored to death by a boar; and the
<b>Hyacinth</b> is supposed to have originated in a
similar manner after Hyacinth had fallen a victim
to the jealousy of Zephyr. The <b>Aspasia</b> bears the
name of Aspasia of Miletus, the mistress of Pericles.
The term <b>Orchid</b> comes from the Greek <i>orchis</i>, a
testicle, all plants of this family being distinguished
by double testicles. The <b>Sweetbriar</b> is literally a
“fragrant thorn”; the <b>Lilac</b> betrays its Eastern
origin in the Turkish <i>leilak</i>, and Persian <i>lilaj</i>; while
the term <b>Lavender</b> is derived from the Latin <i>lavere</i>,
to wash, because the essential oil obtained from this
shrub enters into the composition of a favourite
scent.</p>

<p>The <b>Dog-rose</b> was so called by the Greeks from
the belief that the root of this particular rose-tree
was efficacious in curing the bite of a mad dog.
The <b>Damask-rose</b> was brought to England from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Damascus by Dr. Linacre in 1540. The <b>Cabbage-rose</b>
is thick and compact like a cabbage. The
<b>Christmas-rose</b> makes its appearance about Christmas-time.
The word <b>Primrose</b>, agreeably to the
Latin <i>prima rosa</i>, signifies the first rose, or flower, of
spring.</p>

<p>The <b>Mayflower</b>, otherwise the <b>Hawthorn</b>, the
Anglo-Saxon for “hedge-thorn,” appears in flower
in the month of May, while <b>Gilly-flower</b> is merely
a corruption of “July flower.” The <b>Tiger-flower</b>
is streaked like a tiger. <b>Daffodil</b> is a corruption of
“d’Asphodele,” the French name of this flower.
<b>Hollyhock</b> is not “Holy Oak,” but the Anglo-Saxon
<i>holi-hoc</i>, or marsh mallow. The <b>Noon-tide</b>,
or <b>Noon-flower</b>, closes its petals at noon; the
<b>Convolvulus</b>, so called from the Latin <i>con</i>, together,
and <i>volvere</i>, to roll, does the like at sunset, in common
with the ordinary field <b>Daisy</b>, which owes its name,
a corruption of the Anglo-Saxon <i>doeges-eaye</i>, literally
“the day’s eye,” to this circumstance. The <b>Buttercup</b>
was originally so designated in accordance with
an old-established idea that the yellow hue of butter
was attributable to the fact of these flowers being
eaten by cattle. However, as the buttercups are
invariably avoided by the cattle, the proverbial
wisdom of our forefathers must for once in a way
be discredited. <b>Cowslip</b> is a corruption of “cows’
leek.”</p>

<p>The very common supposition that the <b>Sunflower</b>
inclines towards the sun is entirely erroneous, as has
been proved by observation. This flower merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
takes its name from its form and colour. On the
other hand, if its etymology be correct, the <b>Heliotrope</b>
does actually turn towards the sun, the word
<i>helios</i> being Greek for sun, and <i>tropos</i>, to turn. The
<b>Goldylocks</b> is so called on account of its tufts of
yellow flowers; whereas the <b>Marigold</b>, which bears
yellow flowers, was named in honour of Queen
Mary. Both these, with the Sunflower, belong to
the <b>Chrysanthemum</b> (Greek <i>chrusos</i>, gold, and
<i>anthemos</i>, flower) family. The word <b>Rhododendron</b>,
we may add, comes from the Greek <i>rhodon</i>,
rose, and <i>dendron</i>, tree.</p>

<p>The <b>Passion-flower</b> symbolizes in its tints
and several parts the various attributes of Christ’s
Passion, as follows:&mdash;The white tint, purity; the
blue tint, heaven; the leaf, the spear; the five
anthers, the five wounds; the tendrils, the whips
and cords; the column of the ovary, the pillar of the
cross; the stamens, the hammers; the three styles,
the nails; the fleshy thorns within the flowers, the
crown of thorns; the calyx, the nimbus, or glory.
In addition to the foregoing the passion-flower
remains open for three days, and this is supposed
to correspond with the three years’ ministry of the
Redeemer.</p>

<p>Lastly, the flower known as the <b>Stock</b> received
its name from the fact that it was principally sold
in the old <span class="smcap">Stocks Market</span> displaced by the building
of the present Mansion House in the year 1737; the
market itself having derived its title from a pair of
stocks that stood there.</p>

<h2 id="THE_BIBLE"><i>THE BIBLE.</i></h2>

<p>In the estimation of many millions of human
beings the Bible is very properly regarded as
the “Book of Books.” And a Book of Books
it truly is; not only <span class="smcap">The</span> Book above all others, but
comprising a number of distinct works from the
pens of various Inspired Writers according to the
Old Law and the New. For this reason precisely
the earliest Saxon version of the Sacred Volume was
called the <b>Bible</b> in accordance with the Greek and
Latin word <i>biblia</i>, the plural of <i>biblion</i>, a book,
derived from biblos, the inner bark of the papyrus,
which was the first kind of writing material known.
“Bible,” therefore, is a collective term for the <b>Scriptures</b>,
which designation comes from the Latin
<i>scriptura</i>, a writing, based upon the verb <i>scribere</i>,
to write. Here, again, note the correct use of the
plural.</p>

<p>The original translation of the Hebrew Testament
into Greek, about the year 260 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, bore the title of
the <b>Septuagint</b> because it employed the labours of
seventy, or rather of seventy-two, translators. More
than six hundred years afterwards, viz., in the Year
of Our Lord 405, when St. Jerome (born 346, died
420) rendered the whole of the Scriptures&mdash;to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
sure the New Testament had not an existence
at the time of the Greek translation&mdash;into the Latin
tongue, his performance was styled the <i>Vulgatus</i>,
or <b>Vulgate</b>, from <i>vulgare</i>, to make known to
the <i>vulgus</i>, the multitude. This <b>Latin Vulgate</b>
constitutes the Bible of the Roman Catholics
as authorized by the Council of Trent in the
year 1546. It was first printed for the use
of the Christian world generally in 1462. The
English translation of the Old Testament portion
of the Vulgate bears the title of the <b>Douay Bible</b>
because it was first printed and published at the
English College at Douay, in France, in 1609. The
New Testament portion, known as the <b>Rheims
Bible</b>, was issued at Rheims twenty-seven years
earlier, viz., in 1582.</p>

<p>The <b>Authorized Version</b> of the Bible appointed
to be read in the Church of England is called <b>King
James’s Bible</b>, after James I., who ordered it to
be prepared, and in whose reign (in the year 1611)
it was first given to the people. The <b>Bishops’
Bible</b>, published in parts between 1568 and 1572,
derived its name from the seven bishops that
assisted Archbishop Parker with his revision of
<b>Cranmer’s Bible</b>, otherwise <b>The Great Bible</b>, so
called because Archbishop Cranmer’s version of the
text, published in 1539, was of large size, specially
printed for the purpose of being displayed and read
by the people in the churches. To the 1540 edition
of this version Cranmer prefixed a lengthy Introduction.
One of the earliest Latin Bibles, printed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
by Gutenberg between the years 1450 and 1455,
and, indeed, one of the earliest perfect printed
books from separate types, is known as the <b>Mazarin
Bible</b>, from a copy being discovered in Cardinal
Mazarin’s library. The <b>Pearl Bible</b> was so called
because it was printed in pearl type by Field in
1653. The <b>Geneva Bible</b>, printed at Geneva in
1560, also bears the singular title of the <b>Breeches
Bible</b>, owing to the substitution of the word
“breeches” for “aprons” in <i>Genesis</i> iii. 7. Similarly,
the <b>Vinegar Bible</b> is indebted for its title
to the misprinting of the word “vineyard” in the
running headline to <i>Luke</i> xx. at the Clarendon Press
in 1717; the <b>Beer Bible</b>, to the substitution of the
words “the beer” for “strong drink” in the
twenty-fourth chapter of <i>Isaiah</i>, ninth verse; the
<b>Treacle Bible</b>, to the rendering of the passage,
“Is there no balm in Gilead?” into “There is no
more triacle at Gilaad” (<i>Jeremiah</i> viii. 22); the <b>Whig
Bible</b>, to the misprinting of the word “peacemakers,”
so that the sentence reads, “Blessed are
the placemakers”; the <b>Wicked Bible</b>, from the
omission of a word in <i>Exodus</i> xx. 14, which caused
the verse to read, “Thou shalt commit adultery”;
and the <b>Bug Bible</b>, printed by John Daye in 1551,
from the peculiar rendering of the fifth verse in
<i>Psalm</i> xci., which reads, “So thou shalt not need
to be afraid for any <i>bugs</i> by night, nor for the arrow
that flieth by day.” The first edition of the Authorized
Version is called the <b>“He” Bible</b>, because it
contains a misprint in <i>Ruth</i> iii. 15, the passage reading,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
“And he went into the city.” A subsequent
issue published in the same year, in which the
mistake is rectified, is known as the <b>“She” Bible</b>.
The <b>Virginia Bible</b> is a rare version of the Scriptures
translated into the native language of the
North American Indians of Virginia. The first
edition of this Bible was printed in 1661-3, copies
of which are said to be worth £200.</p>

<p>The first five books of the Old Testament written
by Moses bear the collective title of the <b>Pentateuch</b>
on account of the two Greek words <i>penta</i>, five, and
<i>teuchos</i>, an implement, a tool, alluding to the Books
being the direct instrument of communication between
God and His people. The titles of these five
Books themselves are as follows:&mdash;<b>Genesis</b>, which
expresses the Greek for origin or production, describes
the history of the world from its beginning; <b>Exodus</b>,
derived from <i>ex</i>, out, and <i>odus</i>, a way, narrates the
departure of the Israelites out of Egypt; <b>Leviticus</b>
sets forth the regulations affecting the priests and
Levites; <b>Numbers</b> contains the census of the
Israelites; and <b>Deuteronomy</b>, from the Greek
<i>deuteros</i>, second, and <i>nomos</i>, law, comprises the
second giving of the Law by Moses.</p>

<p>The designation <b>Apocrypha</b>, signifying hidden or
spurious, is applied to those Books whose authenticity
as Inspired Writings is not admitted; in other
words, to those portions of the Scriptures which,
inasmuch as they do not establish any doctrine, are
not held to be canonical, yet are such as, in the
words of the Prayer Book, “the Church doth read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
for example of life and instruction of manners.” On
the other hand, the <b>Apocalypse</b>, signifying disclosure,
is synonymous with the “Book of Revelation,”
and specifically applies to the concluding Book of
the Bible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="WINES"><i>WINES.</i></h2>

<p>With one or two exceptions only, the
different kinds of wines owe their names
to the places where they are produced.
Thus, <b>Burgundy</b> and <b>Champagne</b> respectively
come from the French provinces, <b>Pontac</b> from the
town, and <b>Moselle</b> from the vineyards extensively
cultivated on the banks of the river, so designated.
Rhenish wines are popular all over Europe; yet
none are probably more celebrated than the <b>Johannisberg</b>,
produced at the Castle of Johannisberg
(literally, John’s Rock), near Wiesbaden, and <b>Hock</b>,
produced at Hockheim. Among Italian wines,
<b>Florence</b> comes from the historic “City of
Flowers,” whereas <b>Falernian</b>, celebrated by Martial,
Horace, and other Latin authors, was made from
grapes grown in the district around the ancient city
of Falernum. A justly celebrated Tuscan wine is the
<b>Montepulciano</b>, produced at the old city so denominated.
As its name implies, <b>Malaga</b> is imported
from Malaga, in Spain; <b>Sherry</b> is our English
rendering of the place-name Xeres, near Cadiz;
while <b>Port</b> constitutes the native wine of Oporto,
the capital of Portugal. Of Mediterranean wines,
<b>Cyprus</b>, brought from the now British island of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
that name, and <b>Malmsey</b>, an English corruption of
<b>Malvasia</b>, so termed after the district in the island
of Candia, where it is produced, are the chief.
<b>Madeira</b> and <b>Canary</b> are imported from the islands
so called, situated on the great ocean highway to the
Cape of Good Hope. An excellent wine greatly
sought after on the Continent, though somewhat
unknown in this country, is <b>Tokay</b>, produced from
white grapes cultivated in the district of Tokay,
Upper Hungary. <b>Claret</b> owes its designation to
the French <i>clair</i>, clear, because it is a clarified wine;
whereas <b>Tent Wine</b> is a mere corruption of the
Spanish <i>vino tinto</i>, signifying a white wine coloured.
The sparkling champagne known as <b>Sillery</b> popularizes
the name of the Marquis de Sillery, the
proprietor of the vineyards where this particular
species is produced; just as <b>Pommery</b> is destined
to perpetuate the memory of Madame Pommery,
mother to the Duchess de Polignac, and sole
proprietress of the vineyards and subterranean
Pommery vaults near Rheims. <b>Moet and Chandon</b>
similarly denotes the champagne brewed by the
well-known French firm trading under the style of
“Moet et Chandon.”</p>

<p>Among concoctions of the vinous order we have
<b>Hippocras</b>, so called because it is said to have
been first made according to the recipe of Hippocrates,
the Father of Medicine; <b>Badminton</b>,
originally prepared at Badminton, the seat of the
Duke of Beaufort; and <b>Negus</b>, named after Colonel
Francis Negus, who invented it. Formerly, our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
countrymen set great store by <b>Sack</b>, which was
simply the designation of a dry wine, derived from
the French word <i>sec</i>, dry. Wine is said to be a <b>Dry
Wine</b> when it is neither sweet nor sparkling. It
cannot be sweet because, the fermentation being
complete, the sugar contained in it is fully decomposed;
moreover, it is dry because the carbonic acid
has escaped. For the like reason, a certain evidence
that port wine has completed the process of fermentation
is the collection of tartar in the interior of the
bottle, forming a crust; hence the term <b>Crusted
Port</b>. A very bad wine of whatever kind usually
bears the name of <b>Three Men Wine</b>, owing to
the idea that it requires one man to hold the drinker,
and another to pour it down his throat, while the
third is the unfortunate individual himself. The
derivation of the term <b>Wine</b> is the Anglo-Saxon <i>vin</i>
from the Latin <i>vinum</i>, allied to <i>vinea</i>, a vine.</p>

<h2 id="LITERARY_SOBRIQUETS"><i>LITERARY SOBRIQUETS.</i></h2>

<p>Gildas, the earliest chronicler of British
history (born 511, died 570), was surnamed
<b>The Wise</b> on account of his learning,
which must have excited the wonder of the semi-barbarian
inhabitants of these islands in the sixth
century. Later, the Saxon historian Beda, incorrectly
called Bede (born 673, died 735), was surnamed <b>The
Venerable</b> because he was also an ecclesiastic. Approaching
more modern times, we meet with John
White, a Nonconformist lawyer, who, in consequence
of being the author of a work entitled “The First
Century of Scandalous, Malignant Priests, made and
admitted into Benefices by the Prelates, &amp;c.,” merited
the popular description of <b>Century White</b>. Still
nearer our own day, Matthew Gregory Lewis (born
1775, died 1818) became the recipient of the name of
<b>Monk Lewis</b>, after the publication of his famous
novel, “The Monk”; just as John Thomas Smith,
the antiquary (born 1766, died 1833), was indebted
to his chatty, albeit valuable work, “A Book for
a Rainy Day,” for his sobriquet of <b>Rainy-Day
Smith</b>.</p>

<p>Turning to the poets, John Sylvester, the translator
of Du Barta’s “Divine Weeks and Works”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
(born 1563, died 1613), is popularly referred to as
<b>Silver-tongued Sylvester</b> on account of the
sweet melody of his verse. John Taylor, <b>The
Water Poet</b> (born 1580, died 1654), was a Thames
waterman; James Hogg, <b>The Ettrick Shepherd</b>
(born 1772, died 1835), followed the employment of
a shepherd in the forest of Ettrick, Selkirkshire; and
Edward Capern, <b>The Bidëford Postman</b> (born
1819), was for several years a letter-carrier in the
little town of Bidëford, Devonshire. Nathaniel Lee
(born 1655, died 1691) received the name of <b>The
Mad Poet</b> from the fact of his four years’ confinement
in a mad-house. <b>The Quaker Poet</b> was
Bernard Barton, the friend of Charles Lamb (born
1784, died 1849); while Samuel Rogers, <b>The
Banker Poet</b> (born 1763, died 1855), divided his
time pleasantly between the counting-house and
the study. Thomas Moore (born 1779, died 1852)
merited the style of <b>Anacreon Moore</b> by his
translations from the Greek poet Anacreon, and the
circumstance that his own original verses were constructed
upon the same classic model. Richard
Horne, the poet and critic (born 1802, died 1884),
was known as <b>Orion Horne</b>, and also as <b>The
Farthing Poet</b>, on account of his principal work
“Orion,” published at one farthing, as a satire on
the poverty of the book-buying public.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott (born 1771, died 1832) was
surnamed <b>The Wizard of the North</b> owing to
the magic influence which he exerted over all
classes of the people, and the widespread fascination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
of his novels; while Henry Mackenzie, the author
of “The Man of Feeling” (born 1745, died 1831),
enjoyed the signal honour of being designated
<b>The Addison of the North</b>, owing to the purity
and excellence of his style. No more flattering
recognition of the genius of William Wordsworth
(born 1770, died 1850) could ever have been desired
than the title of <b>The Minstrel of the Border</b>,
bestowed upon him by Sir Walter Scott. <b>The Corn
Law Rhymer</b> was Ebenezer Elliott (born 1781,
died 1849) who, by the dedication of his numerous
versified philippics to the opponents of Free Trade,
indirectly, if not directly, prepared the way for the
repeal of the obnoxious Corn Laws in the year 1846.
Reference to the word “Philippics” carries us back
in imagination to Demosthenes, who directed one of
his most famous orations against Philip, King of
Macedon; hence, any indignant invective or vehement
denunciation is characteristically styled a
<span class="smcap">Philippic</span>.</p>

<p><b>Northumberland</b> originally denoted
the land north of the Humber; <b>Cumberland</b>,
the land occupied by the Cymri; and
<b>Westmoreland</b>, the land of the Westmorings, or
people of the Western moors. <b>Durham</b> is a
corruption of <i>Dunholm</i>, signifying a hill-fort on an
island in the river; <i>dun</i> being Celtic for a hill, or fort
on a hill, and <i>holm</i> the Scandinavian for an island.
The Shire, or County, of <b>York</b>, in common with the
majority of the Midland and Welsh counties, is
named after its chief town; or rather, in this case,
the ancient city described in documents as <i>Eurewic</i>,
but pronounced <i>Yorric</i>, from its position on the river
Eure, now known as the Ouse.</p>

<p><b>Lancashire</b> indicates the Shire of <b>Lancaster</b>,
the <i>caester</i>, or camp-town, on the Lune. This
Anglo-Saxon word <i>Caester</i>, derived from the Latin
<i>castra</i>, a camp, fortress, appears also in the names
of <b>Cheshire</b>, a contraction of <i>Caestershire</i>, the Shire
of <b>Chester</b>, the town built on the site of the old
Roman <i>castra</i>, or camp; in <b>Leicestershire</b>, the
Shire of the camp-town on the river <i>Leire</i>, now
called the Soar; in <b>Worcestershire</b>, the Shire of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
<i>Hwic-ware-shire</i>, or fortress-town, of the Huiccii;
and in <b>Gloucestershire</b>, the Shire of the camp-town
in which <i>Gloi</i>, a son of the Emperor Claudius,
was born during the Roman occupation of Britain.</p>

<p><b>Lincoln</b> is a contraction of the Latin <i>Lindumcolonia</i>,
signifying the colony formed by the Romans
on the <i>Llyn-dun</i>, literally “the fortified hill by the
pool,” originally occupied and so called by the
ancient Britons [<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_149"><span class="smcap">London</span></a>]. The names <b>Norfolk</b>
and <b>Suffolk</b> respectively indicate those portions of
the eastern coast settled by the Angles, who separated
into two distinct tribes, viz., the north folk and
the south folk. <b>Essex</b> is a contraction of <i>East-seaxe</i>,
denoting the territory occupied by the East
Saxons; <b>Sussex</b>, of <i>Suth-seaxe</i>, or South Saxons;
and <b>Middlesex</b>, of <i>Middle-seaxe</i>, or the inhabitants
of the district between Essex and <b>Wessex</b>, the
land of the West Saxons, which, under the Heptarchy,
extended to the westward as far as
Devon. <b>Surrey</b> is a modification of the Anglo-Saxon
<i>Suth-rey</i>, south of the river, <i>i.e.</i>, the
Thames. <b>Kent</b> was formerly <i>Cantium</i>, indicating
the land bestowed upon Canute, one of the companions
of Brute, an early King of Britain, who,
according to Geoffrey of Monmouth, settled in
England and eventually founded the Danish
dynasty.</p>

<p><b>Hampshire</b>, also written <b>Hants</b>, expresses the
Shire of <i>Hantone</i>, or <i>Hantune</i>, now known as
<b>Southampton</b>, the south town on the river Ant,
or Southampton Water. <b>Dorset</b> was originally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
<i>Dwrset</i>, a compound of the Celtic <i>dwr</i>, water, and
the Anglo-Saxon <i>set</i>, a settlement, alluding to the
early settlement of this district by a tribe of Britons
who styled themselves <i>Dwr-trigs</i>, or “water-dwellers.”
<b>Somerset</b> is a corruption of the Anglo-Saxon <i>Suthmorset</i>,
literally “the south-moor-settlement.” <b>Devon</b>
is a modified form of <i>Dwfuient</i>, the Celtic for “the
deep valleys.” An earlier name for this portion of
Britain was <i>Damnonia</i>, the territory of the Damnonii,
a Celtic tribe. <b>Cornwall</b> denotes the territory
of the “foreigners in the horn,” agreeably to the Latin
<i>cornu</i>, a horn, referring to its numerous promontories,
and its inhabitants the <i>Wahl</i>, the Saxon term for
“foreigners.” Like Wales, this portion of our island
was never invaded by the Anglo-Saxons; consequently
its people, the Cymri, a branch of the Celts, were
left in undisturbed possession [<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_39"><span class="smcap">Wales</span></a>]. The
Duchy of Cornwall is still included in the Principality
of Wales. <b>Wiltshire</b> only partly expresses the
Shire of <b>Wilton</b>, a contraction of <i>Willy-town</i>, or
the town on the river Willy. <b>Berkshire</b> is a
modern spelling of the Anglo-Saxon <i>Bearoc-scire</i>,
“forest shire,” in allusion to the forest districts of
Bagshot and Windsor; while <b>Buckingham</b> was
originally described as <i>Boccenham</i>, the Anglo-Saxon
for “beech-tree-home,” this county being especially
noted for its beeches.</p>

<p><b>Oxford</b> derived its name from the <i>Ox-ford</i> over the
Isis; <b>Hertford</b>, from the ford crossed by harts;
<b>Hereford</b>, from the army ford; and <b>Stafford</b>, from
the ford crossed by means of staves or stilts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
<b>Bedford</b> is a contraction of <i>Bedican ford</i>, the
Anglo-Saxon for “the protected ford.” <b>Cambridge</b>
owes its name to the University town by the bridge
over the <i>Cam</i>, or crooked river [<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_162"><span class="smcap">Camberwell</span></a>].
<b>Huntingdon</b> was anciently a great deer forest, and
therefore much resorted to for hunting. <b>Northampton</b>
is a corruption of <i>North-avon-town</i>, alluding
to its position north of the river <i>Neu</i>, in olden times
known as the Avon. <b>Rutland</b> expresses the Anglo-Saxon
for “red land,” referring to the colour of its
soil. <b>Warwick</b> is the modern description of the
Anglo-Saxon <i>Waer-wic</i>, signifying the garrison, or
war town. <b>Nottingham</b> is a corruption of <i>Snotingaham</i>,
“the place of caves,” so called on account
of the soft sandstone which so greatly facilitated the
formation of caverns during the early history of our
country; as <i>e.g.</i>, “Mortimer’s hole,” and the subterranean
passage that led thereto from Nottingham
Castle in the reign of Edward III. <b>Derby</b> is a
contraction of the Saxon <i>Deer-by</i>, or “wild-beast
village,” doubtless so designated from its frequent
invasion by strange animals from the mountainous
district of “The Peak” in search of prey. <b>Shropshire</b>
denotes the Shire of <i>Scrobbesburgh</i>, the Anglo-Saxon
for “shrub-town,” modified by the Normans
into <i>Sloppesburie</i> (from which the present town of
<b>Salop</b> derived its name), and corrupted in modern
times into <b>Shrewsbury</b>. <b>Monmouth</b> indicates
the county that includes the mouth of the <i>Mon</i>,
originally described as the <i>Mynwy</i>, “the border
river.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Anglesea</b>, properly <i>Anglesey</i> [<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_158"><span class="smcap">Chelsea</span></a>, &amp;c.],
is one of the three counties of Wales whose names
are not essentially Welsh. Thus, <b>Glamorgan</b>
signifies the <i>Gwlad-Morgan</i>, or territory of Morgan,
a chieftain who lived in the tenth century;
<b>Brecknock</b> is the hill of Brecon, or Brychan, a
Welsh prince; <b>Radnor</b> is a modern spelling of
<i>Rhiadnwr-Gwy</i>, meaning “the Cataract of the
Wye”; <b>Montgomery</b> refers to the fortress built
on the <i>mont</i>, or height, by Roger de Montgomerie,
in 1093; <b>Denbigh</b> was originally <i>Dinbach</i>, the Celtic
and Cymric for “a little fort”; <b>Flint</b> was so called
from the quantity of quartz found in this county;
<b>Carnarvon</b> owes its origin to <i>Cær-yu-ar-Fon</i>, the
<i>cær</i>, or fortress, on the <i>arfon</i>, or water; <b>Carmarthen</b>
denotes the fortress erected by Merlin; <b>Merioneth</b>
was named after Merion, an early British saint;
<b>Cardigan</b> indicates the territory of Ceredig, a Welsh
chieftain; while <b>Pembroke</b> signifies the <i>pen</i>, or
head of the <i>broc</i>, the Celtic and Cymric for a district,
so called because this promontory was virtually the
Land’s End.</p>

<h2 id="CARRIAGES"><i>CARRIAGES.</i></h2>

<p>The <b>Phaeton</b> owes its designation to the
mythological personage of that name who
received permission to drive the sun-car of
Helios, his father, for one day, with the result that,
being overthrown, he nearly set the world on fire.
The <b>Victoria</b> was introduced in the year that
witnessed the coronation of Her Majesty Queen
Victoria. The <b>Clarence</b> was the favourite conveyance
of the Duke of Clarence, afterwards William
IV. The <b>Brougham</b>, invented in 1839, received its
name from Lord Brougham, who was the first to
permanently adopt it; and the same may be said of
the <b>Stanhope</b>, so called in compliment to Lord
Stanhope. The <b>Sociable</b> is an appropriate name
enough for an open carriage of which the facing
seats afford opportunity for pleasant conversation.
The <b>Landau</b> was first made at Landau in Germany;
whereas the <b>Tilbury</b> perpetuates the name of a
celebrated London sportsman who introduced this
particular species of carriage during the early part
of the present century.</p>

<p>The small, light, one-horse vehicle known as a
<b>Dog-cart</b> is so called because such a one was
originally constructed for sportsmen to drive their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
pointers and setters (which they kept in a box under
the seat) to the scene of the sport. The term <b>Buggy</b>
is a corruption of <i>Bourgeois</i>, a French name indicating
a vehicle intended for the middle classes so denominated;
while <b>Gig</b> is a contraction of the Italian <i>giga</i>,
a romp, and the French <i>gigue</i>, a lively dance, a jig,
in allusion to its jumping and rocking motion. The
like derivation applies to the long, light ship’s wherry
which passes under the same name. The term
<b>Sulky</b>, as applied to a light two-wheeled conveyance,
owed its origin to the fact that, when it
was introduced, people hazarded the opinion that
none but sulky, morose, and selfish people would ride
in such a carriage, because it had only accommodation
for one person. The <b>Noddy</b>, peculiar to Dublin,
derives its title from the jolting motion which keeps
its riders continually nodding; and the <b>Jaunting
Car</b>, from the jaunts and country outings for which,
on the other side of the Irish Sea, these vehicles are
largely employed. The English <b>Break</b> bears its
name because it partakes of the character of the
four-wheel vehicle used by horse-breakers; indeed,
it differs from the latter only in the addition of the
upper portion containing the seats.</p>

<p><b>Stage-coaches</b> were originally so called on account
of the different stages at which they stopped to
change horses and refresh the passengers. <b>’Bus</b> is
short for <b>Omnibus</b>, a Latin word signifying “for
all.” The step at the back of an omnibus is
facetiously styled the <b>Monkey-board</b>, in consequence
of the capers usually executed thereon by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the conductor. The board on either side of the
roof of the vehicle, upon which theatrical and other
advertisements are exhibited is known as the <b>Knife-board</b>,
from its fancied resemblance to that article
of domestic utility. So far from having derived its
name from one of the northern suburbs of London, a
<b>Hackney-coach</b> is simply an English rendering of
<i>coche-a-haquence</i>, the literal French for a coach drawn
by a hired horse. The word <b>Coach</b> (French, <i>coche</i>,
the diminutive of the Italian <i>conchula</i>, a shell) really
means a shell-like contrivance upon wheels. <b>Cab</b> is a
contraction of the <b>Cabriolet</b>, from <i>cabriole</i>, a goat’s
leap, in allusion to its lightness and springiness, first
introduced in Paris. This vehicle, after undergoing
sundry changes and improvements, was patented in
the year 1883 as the “Safety Cab” by Joseph
Aloysius Hansom, from which circumstance it has
in more recent times come to be generally designated
the <b>Hansom Cab</b>.</p>

<p>The term <b>Hearse</b> traces its origin through the
German <i>hirsch</i> from the Gothic <i>hersa</i>, a sepulchral
mound. At a later date it implied a temporary
monument, but nowadays it denotes the funeral car.
The word <b>Funeral</b>, by the way, is a contraction of
the Latin <i>funeralis</i>, signifying a torchlight procession,
from <i>funis</i>, a torch, because interments among the
Romans always took place by night. <b>Pantechnicon</b>
is a Greek word, composed of <i>pan</i>, all,
and <i>techne</i>, art, indicative of the place where every
kind of industrial art was exhibited or exposed for
sale. In modern days the term has come to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
exclusively applied to a vehicle constructed for the
removal of household furniture. Lastly, the cloth
that covers the box-seat of a carriage of any kind
is called the <b>Hammer-cloth</b>, because in the old
coaching days it concealed the box which contained
a hammer, nails, and other implements useful for
repairs in the event of a breakdown on the journey.</p>

<h2 id="DANCES"><i>DANCES.</i></h2>

<p>Dancing is styled the <b>Terpsichorean Art</b>
in honour of Terpsichore, the daughter of
Jupiter and Mnemosyne, whom the ancients
regarded as its inventress. The <b>Morris Dance</b>, from
which our “Jack in the Green” and his fellow May-day
revellers trace their origin, was the military
dance of the Moors, or Moriscoes, introduced into
this country by John of Gaunt on his return from
Spain in the reign of Edward III. Five men and a
boy took part in it, and from the fact of the boy
wearing an ill-fitting helmet called a <i>morione</i>, he
received the name of “Mad Morion,” which was
subsequently corrupted into <b>Maid Marian</b>. The
<b>Saraband</b> was invented by Zarabanda, a famous
dancer of Seville in the sixteenth century. The
<b>Gavotte</b> arose among the Gavots, a people who
inhabited the department of the Upper Alps and the
province of Dauphiny, in France. <b>Quadrille</b> is the
literal French for “a little square,” so called from
the position taken up by the dancers; while the
Lancers derived their name from a company of
<b>Lancers</b> who originally improvised this variation of
the Quadrille for their own amusement while seated
in their saddles. The <b>Polka</b>, of Polish origin, is so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
designated on account of the Bohemian word <i>pulka</i>,
a half, in allusion to the half step occurring in it;
the <b>Schottische</b> is a variation of the Polka; the
<b>Mazourka</b> is the national dance of Poland&mdash;all of
which, with the addition of the <b>Redowa</b>, are native
terms. The <b>Waltz</b> is a contraction of the German
<b>Waltzer</b>, derived from the verb <i>waltzen</i>, to roll, to
revolve, alluding to the revolutions made by the
pairs of dancers placed <i>vis-à-vis</i>. The <b>Country
Dance</b>, so far from being a peasants’ dance, is
nothing more than a corruption of the French
<i>contre-danse</i>, signifying that the parties place themselves
opposite to each other during the dance.
Strictly speaking, the Contre-danse and the Quadrille
are one and the same. The <b>Roger de
Coverley</b> derived its name from the great-grandfather
of Roger de Coverley, or rather, to be
precise, of Roger of Cowley, near Oxford, who
invented it. The <b>Minuet</b> (Latin <i>minutus</i>, small)
is so called wholly on account of the short steps
peculiar to this dance. The <b>Tarantella</b> was invented
in Italy out of the supposition that the profuse
perspiration which it induced was a certain cure
for the poisonous bite of the <span class="smcap">Tarantula Spider</span>,
named after the city of Taranto, where its baneful
presence was first manifested. <b>Cinderella Dances</b>
are those which terminate before midnight, in allusion
to Cinderella of nursery renown.</p>

<p>The origin of the word <b>Ball</b>, in its application to
a dancing-party, is somewhat singular. Centuries
ago there was in vogue on the Continent a three-fold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
game, in which the players danced to the sound
of their own voices while they threw to one another
a ball. In all probability this arose out of the
curious “Ball-Play in Church” by the Neapolitans
during the Saturnalia, or “Feast of Fools,” corresponding
to our Easter-tide. There is even now a
statute in existence which regulated the size and
character of the ball to be used on such occasions.
In opening the ceremony, the Dean took the ball in
his left hand, and commenced an antiphon, which
the organ took up; whereupon he tossed the ball to
first one and then another of the choir-boys, as they
joined hands, sang, and danced around him. When,
therefore, the three-fold game alluded to above
divided and its three sets of dancers became
independent of each other, the dance itself took
the name of the article that was, as if by common
consent, discarded&mdash;to wit, <i>the ball</i>; and the song
was styled the <i>Ballata</i>, or, according to the modern
English, a <span class="smcap">Ballad</span> indicative of a dancing-song;
while the verb <i>ballare</i>, to dance, gave existence to
the French <b>Ballet</b>, signifying a dance tune. <i>Apropos</i>
of the Ballet, the term <b>Coryphée</b>, as applied to a
ballet-dancer, traces its origin from the Greek
<i>coryphœus</i>, the designation of one who danced to
the lute in the theatres of the ancients. <i>En passant</i>,
the famous war dance of the Greeks, executed in
very quick time and known as the <b>Phyrric Dance</b>,
was so denominated after Pyrrichos, a celebrated
Dorian flautist.</p>

<p>The <b>Hornpipe</b> is an inversion of <i>pib-gorn</i>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
name of the old Welsh instrument consisting of a
<i>pib</i>, or pipe, with a <i>gorn</i>, or horn, at each end, to
which this dance was originally stepped; the <b>Reel</b>
has reference to the whirling evolutions performed
by the dancer, as of winding cotton on a reel;
whereas the <b>Jig</b> comes from the French <i>gigue</i>, a
lively dance, and <i>gige</i>, a stringed instrument, the
usual accompaniment to this rough-and-ready style
of pedal exhilaration. The term <b>Breakdown</b> is an
Americanism, denoting the last boisterous dance
before the breaking <i>up</i> of a dancing-party towards
early morning. Appropriately enough, such a dance
invariably constitutes the final item of a negro-minstrel
entertainment.</p>

<h2 id="PIGMENTS_AND_DYES"><i>PIGMENTS AND DYES.</i></h2>

<p>The word <b>Pigment</b> is a contraction of the
Latin <i>pigmentum</i>, based upon the verb <i>pingere</i>,
to paint. <b>Dye</b> traces its origin to the
Anglo-Saxon <i>deag</i>, a colour, remotely derived from
the Latin <i>tingere</i>, to stain. Several of the pigments
most generally used owe their names to the places
whence they are, or were originally, brought. As
examples: <b>Umber</b> was first obtained in the district
of <b>Umbria</b>, in Italy, and <b>Sienna</b>, properly called
<i>Terra di Sienna</i>, or Sienna Earth, from Sienna;
<b>Gamboge</b> comes from Cambodia, formerly known
as Gambogia, in Siam; <b>Indigo</b>, from Indicus, the
ancient description of India; and <b>Krems White</b>,
from the city of Krems, in Austria, where it is
exclusively manufactured. <b>Prussian Red</b>, <b>Brunswick
Green</b>, <b>Brunswick Black</b>, <b>Frankfort
Black</b>, <b>Hamburg Lake</b>, <b>Venetian Red</b>, and
<b>Chinese Yellow</b>, speak for themselves. <b>Prussian
Blue</b>, also called <b>Berlin Blue</b>, was first made by
a native colourman of Berlin in the year 1710;
whereas <b>Saunders Blue</b> is merely a corruption
of <i>cendres-bleus</i>, the French for blue ashes, this
pigment being obtained from calcined bluestone.
Another name for the latter is <b>Ultramarine</b>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
because it was originally brought from <i>ultra</i>, beyond,
and <i>marinus</i>, the sea.</p>

<p>The deep blue known as <b>Mazarine</b> was named
after Cardinal Mazarin, the Prime Minister of France
(born 1602, died 1661), in whose time it was first prepared;
while the puce colour known as <b>Pompadour</b>
received its designation from Madame le Pompadour,
the mistress of Louis XV. (born 1721, died 1764), who
popularized it. <b>Cardinal</b> is so called because it
expresses the exact shade of the red habit worn by
the cardinals of the Church; the term <b>Carmine</b>
owes its origin to the Italian <i>carminio</i>, purple; while
<b>Carnation</b> denotes a flesh tint, in accordance with
the Latin <i>caro</i>, flesh. The colour which results
from the combination of a vivid red with more or
less white is styled <b>Pink</b>, owing to its resemblance
to the flower so designated.</p>

<p>The origin of the word <b>Purple</b> must be sought in
connection with the circumstance in which this dye,
or colour, was discovered. It appears that one day
a favourite dog belonging to Hercules of Tyre
chanced to eat a species of fish known to the
ancients as the <i>purpura</i>; and upon returning to his
master, the latter found the lips of the animal tinged
with the colour that was shortly afterwards imitated
and denominated <i>purple</i>. The term <b>Scarlet</b> is a
modification of <i>sakarlat</i>, the Persian description of a
bright red colour; while <b>Crimson</b> traces its existence
through the Old English <i>crimosyn</i> to <i>garmaz</i>,
the Arabic term for the cochineal insect, from whose
dried body, found upon a species of cactus, this vivid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
dye-stuff is obtained. The beautiful purple obtained
from chloride of gold bears the name of <b>Cassius</b>
after its inventor.</p>

<p><b>Magenta</b> was named in commemoration of the
Battle of Magenta, fought in 1859; and <b>Vandyke
Brown</b>, from its having been so frequently used by
Vandyk (born 1599, died 1641) that it forms a
characteristic colour in all his portraits. <b>Sepia</b> is
the Greek designation of the cuttle-fish, and the
pigment so called is obtained from the dark juice
secreted by the glands of the Indian species of this
fish. <b>Sap-Green</b> is prepared from the juice of the
ripe berries of the buckthorn; whereas <b>Emerald
Green</b> denotes the particular shade of green that
characterizes the emerald. <b>Lamp Black</b> is so
called because it was originally obtained from the
burning of resinous matter over a lamp. <b>Ivory
Black</b> is a pigment formerly obtained from charred
ivory, but nowadays from bones. The origin of
<b>Isabel</b>, a dull brownish-yellow, with a mixture of
red and grey, is as follows:&mdash;When the Duke of
Austria was besieging Ostend in 1601, Isabella, his
wife, the daughter of Philip II. of Spain, vowed that
she would not change her linen until the town had
been taken. Unfortunately for her personal comfort,
the town held out for two years, at the end of which
period her linen assumed the characteristic hue that
was afterwards imitated by the ingenious colourman
who sought to honour her by perpetuating the
incident.</p>

<h2 id="LONDON_DISTRICTS_AND"><i>LONDON DISTRICTS AND

<p>At that remote period when the first rude huts
were established on the banks of the Thames,
the surrounding scene could have presented
nothing more inviting to the eye than an extensive
marsh or morass. That such was undoubtedly the
case the existing names of <span class="smcap">Fenchurch</span> Street and
<span class="smcap">Finsbury</span>, furnish ample evidence. The former
marks the site of an ancient church situated among
the fens, while the latter is an easy corruption of
<i>Fensbury</i>, the Anglo-Saxon designation for “a town
among the fens.” Therefore it was not surprising that
the barbaric Britons, who founded what we now call
<b>London</b>, should have given the name of <i>Llyn-dun</i>
[<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_134"><span class="smcap">Lincoln</span></a>] to their colony beside the Thames.
<i>Apropos</i> of the <b>Thames</b>, the name of our noble river
is merely a slight contraction of the Latin <i>Thamesis</i>,
signifying “the broad Isis.” <b>Isis</b> is the Celtic for
water.</p>

<p><b>Westminster</b> was denominated after the Abbey
[<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_212"><span class="smcap">Westminster Abbey</span></a>]. <b>Belgravia</b> is the name
given to the fashionable district of which Belgrave
Square is the common centre. <b>Pimlico</b> owed its
designation to an attempt on the part of the tavern-keepers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
of this neighbourhood to rival the celebrated
nut-brown ales of one Ben Pimlico, who kept a
pleasure-garden near Hoxton, the road to which
was known as <b>Pimlico Walk</b> (still in existence),
and the garden itself, first as “Pimlico’s,” and subsequently
as “Pimlico.” The name of <b>Knightsbridge</b>
carries us back to the time when two knights,
on their way to receive a blessing from the Bishop
of London at Fulham, engaged in a deadly combat
on the bridge that spanned the Westbourne, exactly
on the spot where Albert Gate now stands. Prior
to this incident the bridge had borne the name of
Fulham Bridge. <b>Mayfair</b> occupies the site of an
annual six days’ fair held in May, originally at the
instance of Edward I., for the benefit of the leper
hospital of St. James the Less, Bishop of Jerusalem,
now St. James’s Palace. The district of <b>Soho</b> was
known by its present name as long ago as the sixteenth
century; “<i>So ho!</i>” being the cry of the
huntsmen when calling off their harriers in the days
when the whole of London west of Drury Lane
was open country. <b>Bloomsbury</b> is a corruption of
“Lomesbury Village,” of which the Manor House
stood on the site of Bloomsbury Square. <b>Smithfield</b>
is a modern perversion of “Smoothfield,” an
extensive tract of meadow land where horses were
sold and tournaments were held as far back as the
twelfth century. The first recorded English horse-race
was witnessed in Smoothfield in the year 1154.
<b>Clerkenwell</b> derived its name from an ancient well
(now marked by an iron pump let into the wall at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the south-east end of Ray Street) beside which
the parish clerks performed their Miracle Plays.
<b>Spa Fields</b>, now built over, owed their designation
to a medicinal well, or Spa, discovered in 1206, and
subsequently known as “The London Spa.” The
proper description of <b>Bunhill Fields</b> is <i>Bonhill</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
“good hill” Fields, so styled because the victims of
the Great Plague were buried here in 1665. <b>Moorfields</b>
was formerly a bleak moor skirting the
northern portion of the marshy land known as
Fensbury, now <b>Finsbury</b>, already referred to.</p>

<p><b>Shoreditch</b> did not receive its name from Jane
Shore, neither is the word a corruption of “Sewer
Ditch,” as some writers have suggested. This district
really comprised the manor of Sir John Soerditch,
a wealthy London citizen and a valiant knight who
fought by the side of Edward the Black Prince at
Crecy and Poictiers. <b>Whitechapel</b> was designated
after the White Chapel of St. Mary, built in 1673.
<b>Goodman’s Fields</b> perpetuated the name of the
owner of the land now known as the Minories, upon
which a Priory of the Nuns of St. Clare was afterwards
built. <b>Shadwell</b> is a corruption of St. Chad’s
Well, discovered in this neighbourhood in ancient
times. The once-notorious <b>Ratcliffe Highway</b>
derived its name from the Manor of Ratcliffe, belonging
to the adjoining parish of Stepney. The
title has now been changed to St. George’s Street.
<b>Stepney</b> was anciently described as <i>Stebenhithe</i>,
signifying that it contained a wharf or haven belonging
to one Steben or Steven. <b>Spitalfields</b> marks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the site of the ancient Priory of St. Mary of the
Spittle, dissolved in 1534. The French refugees
established the silk manufacture here in 1685.
<b>Bethnal Green</b> recalls the existence of the old
family of the Bathons, whose history is first recorded
in connection with their property situated in this
neighbourhood during the reign of Edward I.
<b>Hoxton</b> is a corruption of <i>Hogsdon</i>, meaning hog’s
town. In proof of this statement we may add that
<span class="smcap">Hog Lane</span> still exists in the vicinity. <b>De Beauvoir
Town</b> preserves the family name of the De Beauvoirs,
whose original ancestor, Richard de Beauvoir,
of Guernsey, resided here in princely style. <b>Copenhagen
Fields</b> were so called after a tea-house
opened by a Dane, about the time when the King of
Denmark paid a visit to James I. <b>Haggerstone</b> is
a corruption of “Hergotestan,” the literal Saxon
for “Our God’s Town.” <b>Hackney</b> was originally
described as <i>Hackoneye</i>, signifying an <i>ey</i>, or portion
of well-watered pasture land, appropriated by a
Danish chief named Hacon [<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_158"><span class="smcap">Chelsea</span></a>, &amp;c.].</p>

<p><b>Dalston</b> is properly <i>Daleston</i>, or Vale-town.
This was a quiet suburban village situated in a
valley during the days when the northern districts
of the Metropolis were more or less wooded&mdash;as
witness <b>Stoke Newington</b>, or the new town in the
meadow by the wood. The word <i>Stoke</i> comes from
the Anglo-Saxon <i>stoc</i>, a wood or stockade; <i>ton</i> is the
Old English for town, and <i>ing</i> the Anglo-Saxon
for a meadow, also a family settlement. <b>Southgate</b>
is expressive of the southern entrance to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
enclosure, anciently known as Enfield Chase; and
<b>Kingsland</b> the royal domain adjacent to it.
<b>Abney Park</b> owes its name to <span class="smcap">Abney House</span>,
recently converted into a Conservative Club, but
originally the residence of Sir Thomas Abney
(born 1639, died 1722), Lord Mayor and a distinguished
Nonconformist, knighted by William III.
Dr. Isaac Watts died at Abney House in 1748.
<b>Green Lanes</b> indicates the rural character of this
neighbourhood in bygone times. <b>Edmonton</b> is
properly <i>Edmond’s-town</i>. The name of <b>Ball’s Pond</b>
is all that remains to remind us of the one-time
existence of “The Salutation” house of call which
had a pond for dog and duck sports, kept by John
Ball. <b>Mildmay Park</b> is so called after <span class="smcap">Mildmay
House</span>, the family seat of Sir Henry Mildmay, who
came into possession of the estate by his marriage
with the daughter of William Halliday, an Alderman
of the City in the time of Charles I. <b>Muswell
Hill</b> is a slight corruption of <i>Mustwell Hill</i>, derived
from the Latin <i>mustus</i>, new, fresh; because on
this hill there was anciently discovered a well of
clear, fresh water by the friars of St. John’s Priory,
Clerkenwell, who had a dairy hereabouts. That
portion of the hill which has been cut through for the
construction of the line of railway to Enfield, Barnet,
and the north, bears the name of <b>The Hog’s Back</b>,
in allusion to its shape. The name of <b>Wood Green</b>
is self-explanatory. <b>Hornsey</b> is a corruption of
“Harringe,” or meadow of hares. <b>Canonbury</b>
received its title from the residence of the Prior of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the Canons of St. Bartholomew, built in this neighbourhood
soon after the Conquest. <i>Bury</i> is Saxon
for a town or enclosed habitation, equivalent to the
Celtic <i>don</i>, and Old English <i>ton</i>. In days of old,
<b>Highbury</b> contained a Priory of the Knights of St.
John of Jerusalem, built in 1271. The establishment
was called <i>High-bury</i>, because it stood upon higher
ground than their previous residence which had borne
the name of <i>Tolentone</i>, or lower town. <b>Holloway</b>
reminds us that this was once a miry hollow between
Highgate and Islington. <b>Barnsbury</b> is a corruption
of <i>Berners-bury</i>, originally a manor belonging to Lady
Juliana Berners, Abbess of St. Albans. <b>Islington</b>
has always been a favourite suburb in modern
times, and even our mediæval ancestors must have
been delighted with its situation, lying high and
dry beyond the fens and the sloughy neighbourhood
of the “old bourne.” Its name signifies “the
settlement of the Islings.”</p>

<p><b>King’s Cross</b> derived its name from a wretched
statue of George IV., set up in honour of his
accession in 1820, and demolished to make way for
the London terminus of the Great Northern Railway
in 1842. The parish of <b>St. Pancras</b> is so
called after the church dedicated to the boy-saint
who was martyred by Diocletian in the early days
of Christianity. <b>Agar Town</b>, now entirely swept
away by modern improvements, was designated after
William Agar, a miserly lawyer who acquired the
lease of the land for building purposes in 1840.
<b>Somers Town</b> is the property of Lord Somers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
<b>Camden Town</b>, of the Earl of Camden. <b>Kentish
Town</b> was formerly written “Kestestown”; but
even that was a corruption of “Kantelowes Town,”
erected upon the Manor of Kantelowes. The modern
spelling of this family name is <i>Cantlowes</i>. <b>Primrose
Hill</b> is still a pleasant eminence whereon primroses
grow, despite the encroachments of bricks and
mortar all around. <b>Highgate</b> is a title expressive
of the elevated situation of the village that sprang
up around the toll-gate established on the common
highway from Barnet to Gray’s Inn Road about
the year 1400. <b>Holly Village</b>, Highgate, was so
called by its foundress, the Baroness Burdett-Coutts-Bartlett,
after her residence, Holly Lodge, hard by.
<b>Hampstead</b> signifies a farmhouse or homestead.
The word is Saxon: <i>ham</i>, a home, and <i>stede</i>, a place.
In its wider sense, <i>ham</i> denotes a town. The
western slope of Hampstead bears the name of
<b>Frognal</b>, after Frognal Priory, an ambitious edifice
built here by Memory-Corner Thompson (born 1757,
died 1843), in imitation of Horace Walpole’s toy
village on Strawberry Hill. <b>Bishop’s Wood</b>,
Hampstead, comprised the private estate of the
Bishop of London, at the time when that ecclesiastic
resided at Highgate. <b>Gospel Oak</b> received
its designation from the oak that marked the
boundaries of Hampstead and St. Pancras, and
under which, in accordance with an ancient custom,
the Gospel was read once a year. John Whitfield
is said to have preached under this oak. <b>Chalk
Farm</b> is a corruption of “Chalcot Farm,” a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
picturesque farmhouse in whose vicinity duels were
usually fought during the century gone by. <b>St.
John’s Wood</b> was anciently a thickly wooded
district sheltering an “Abbey of the Holy Virgins
of St. John the Baptist.” <b>Kilburn</b> owes its name
to the <i>Kil</i>, the Celtic word for a cell, occupied by
“one Godwyne, a holy hermit,” beside the <i>bourne</i>, or
brook. <b>Maida Vale</b> was so called in commemoration
of the Battle of Maida, in which the English
defeated the French, July 4, 1806. <b>Marylebone</b>
does not signify “Mary the Good,” as the majority of
Londoners imagine, but “St. Mary of the Bourne,”
alluding to the church of St. Mary within sight of
the bourne that ran from the hermit’s cell at <i>Kilbourne</i>
down to <b>Tyburn</b>, or rather <i>Twa-burne</i>; so
called because two different bournes, or streams,
met in the neighbourhood where the Marble Arch
now stands.</p>

<p>The name of <b>Bayswater</b> has undergone considerable
change from the original. Not so very long
ago the whole of this district was known as <b>Bayswater
Fields</b>; during the last century it bore the
name of “Bear’s Watering,” and previously that of
<i>Baynard’s Watering</i>. By the last was meant the
land dotted with pools held from the Manor of
Westminster, by Ralph Baynard, the favourite of
William the Conqueror, who resided at <span class="smcap">Baynard’s
Castle</span>, at Blackfriars, on the north bank of the
Thames. These pools, together with the Tyburn
were converted into what is now styled the <span class="smcap">Serpentine</span>,
owing to its form, in 1733. <b>Paddington</b>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
originally written <i>Padynton</i>, was the settlement or
town of the Pædings, a branch of the family who
originally established themselves at, and gave their
name to, <i>Padendene</i>, in Surrey. <b>Westbourne Park</b>
derived its name from the west bourne, or stream,
that wended its way from the hermit’s cell at
“Kilbourne,” in the direction of the “Baynard’s
Watering,” and thence, after passing under Fulham
(or Knights’) Bridge, emptied itself into the Thames.
<b>Notting Hill</b> is a corruption of <i>Knolton Barn (Hill)</i>,
a manor held by the De Veres, and subsequently by
Robert Fenroper, an Alderman of the City, in the
reign of Henry VIII. The name of <b>Shepherd’s
Bush</b> once more puts us in mind of the pastoral
character of the environs of London in the days gone
by. <b>Acton</b> is an Anglo-Saxon name for “Oak
town,” signifying the town built in the vicinity of the
large Oak Forest. <b>Gunnersbury</b> denotes the town,
or enclosed habitation, named after Gunylda, the
niece of King Canute, who resided here during the
Danish occupation of England. <b>Kew</b> was anciently
described in documents as <i>Kay-hoo</i>, meaning a quay
situated on a <i>hoo</i>, or <i>hoe</i>, the Scandinavian for a spit
of land. <b>Brentford</b> signifies the ford over the
Brent, a tributary of the Thames that takes its rise
near Hendon. <b>Isleworth</b> means a manor beside
the water. The first portion of the word comes from
the Celtic, <i>Isis</i>, water; the second is Anglo-Saxon
for a manor. <b>Staines</b> owes its name to the boundary
stone (Saxon <i>stane</i>, a stone) by the river, which displays
the words “God preserve the City of London.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
The date of this stone is 1280. <b>Kingston</b> was
designated after the King’s stone, now preserved
within railings near the Town Hall, upon which the
Saxon monarchs sat to be anointed. <b>Shepperton</b>
is Old English for <i>Shepherd’s Town</i>, or the abode of
shepherds. The name of <b>Twickenham</b> denotes a
hamlet situated between two tributaries of the
Thames. <b>Richmond</b> was anciently known as
<b>Sheen</b>, a Saxon term for “resplendent,” in allusion
to the palace erected by Edward I. When Henry
VII. rebuilt the palace, after its destruction by fire
in 1479, he changed the name of the village to
Richmond, in perpetuation of his title of Earl of
Richmond prior to ascending the throne. This
king died here in 1509.</p>

<p><b>Chiswick</b> is a corruption of “Cheoselwick,”
derived from the Anglo-Saxon <i>ceosel</i>, sand, gravel,
and the Teutonic <i>wick</i>, a reach, from the root
waes, a moist meadow. <b>Hammersmith</b> was originally
<i>Hammersmeide</i>, a Saxon village distinguished
for the number of its smithies. The forename,
<i>Hammer</i>, is Scandinavian for a village or small town.
<b>Kensington</b> derived its name, or rather that of
<i>Kynsington</i>, the Saxon for King’s meadow, with the
Old English suffix <i>ton</i>, a town, from a royal residence
erected here in very early times. <b>Brompton</b> was
so called from the broom-trees that grew in the
neighbourhood of this healthy <i>ton</i> or town. <b>Chelsea</b>
is described in old documents as “Chevelsey,”
meaning shingle island. The first portion of the
word claims the same etymology as Chiswick, viz.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
<i>ceosel</i>, sand, gravel; while the suffix <i>ey</i>, or <i>ea</i>, is also
Anglo-Saxon, derived from <i>oe</i>, the Scandinavian for
running water. These terminals always indicate
water, and not unfrequently an island, properly so
called; as, for example, Anglesey, the Isle of the
Angles. In the case of Hackney the terminal is
expressive of a well-watered pasture, as has already
been seen; whereas in the cases of Chelsea and
Battersea the allusion is not merely to their
proximity to the Thames, but to their partial isolation
in ancient times from the adjacent land on
account of the creeks and inlets of the river.
<b>Battersea</b>, we may here remark, is described in
Domesday Book as “the Manor of Patricesy”; but
even this early name was a corruption of Petersey,
or St. Peter’s-ey, because it had belonged to the
Abbey of St. Peter’s, Westminster, from time out of
mind. To return: <b>Walham Green</b> denotes a
settlement of foreigners; <i>wal</i>, being a modification of
<i>wahl</i>, the Celtic for foreign, and <i>ham</i>, the Old English
for a home. <b>Fulham</b> was formerly written “Fullenhame,”
the Anglo-Saxon for a habitation of water-fowl.
<b>Parson’s Green</b> received its name from the
parsonage in connection with Fulham Church that
stood here previous to 1740. <b>Percy Cross</b>, Fulham,
is a corruption of “Parson’s Cross,” referring to a
cross on the roof of the parsonage on Parson’s
Green. <b>Putney</b> was originally “Puttaney,” the
Saxon for Putta’s Isle; whereas <b>Wimbledon</b> was
<i>Wibbandun</i>, a Celtic term signifying the <i>dun</i>, or
hill-fort, belonging to one Wibba. The name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
<b>Wandsworth</b> denotes a manor watered by the
Wandle. <b>Lambeth</b> is a corruption of “Loamhithe,”
the Anglo-Saxon for haven of the loamy soil.
<b>Vauxhall</b> is described in a document dated 1282
as the Manor of Faukeshall. As, however, this
manor was originally held by Fulke de Breante soon
after the Conquest, it is highly probable that the
designation was more correctly <i>Fulke’s Hall</i>, afterwards
corrupted into <i>Faukeshall</i>. The present
spelling of the name may be traced back to the year
1615, when the Hall, or Manor House, was occupied
by Jane Vaux.</p>

<p><b>Southwark</b> is a modification of the Anglo-Saxon
“Suthwerk,” and the Danish <i>Sydrike</i>, literally the
south fortification. During the Danish occupation
of England this was a very strong position.
<b>Bermondsey</b> was anciently written <i>Beormundsey</i>,
signifying that the <i>ey</i>, or strip of land intersected by
creeks [<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_158"><span class="smcap">Chelsea</span></a>, &amp;c.], belonged to Beormund,
a prominent Anglo-Saxon lord. <b>Horselydown</b> is
properly <i>Horsadown</i>, so called because this district
was originally a down used for grazing horses.
<b>Walworth</b> was named in honour of Sir William
Walworth, Lord Mayor in 1380, who resided here.
The <b>Borough</b> recalls the fact that the inhabitants
of London south of the Thames were <i>Burghers</i>, and,
therefore, entitled to the rights and privileges of
Corporation.</p>

<p><b>Rotherhithe</b> is Saxon for red haven, alluding to
the colour of the soil. The name of <b>Deptford</b>
indicates the deep ford over the Ravensbourne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
which is now spanned by a bridge. <b>Greenwich</b>
means the green town, or, more precisely, the
verdant settlement beside the <i>wick</i>, or reach of the
river [<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_158"><span class="smcap">Chiswick</span></a>]; whereas <b>Woolwich</b> was
originally <i>Hylwich</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, hill town. The <b>Isle of
Dogs</b> is a corruption of “Isle of Ducks,” so described
in ancient documents on account of the number of
wild-fowl always to be found there. <b>New Cross</b>
derived its name from “The Golden Cross,” a
famous old coaching-house, rebuilt and renamed
“The New Cross.” <b>Lewisham</b> is properly <i>Leawreham</i>,
or meadow-home. <b>Blackheath</b> is a corruption
of <i>Bleakheath</i>. <b>Eltham</b> was formerly written “Ealdham,”
the Anglo-Saxon for the old home or dwelling,
referring to the palace occupied by the English
kings down to the time of James I. <b>Catford</b> is a
contraction of <i>Cattleford</i>, signifying a shallow portion
of the Ravensbourne easily forded by cattle. [The
University town on the Isis received its present
name of <span class="smcap">Oxford</span> for a similar reason.] <b>Beckenham</b>
denotes a home beside the beck or brook. Here
again the Ravensbourne comes into notice. <b>Sydenham</b>
means the home or habitation in the south.
The names of <b>Forest Hill</b>, <b>Norwood</b>, a contraction
of Northwood, and <b>Westwood</b> remind us that the
whole of this district was formerly a large tract of
wooded land. <b>Dulwich</b> is a corruption of <i>Dalewich</i>,
the town in the dale. <b>Honor Oak</b> owes its
designation to the boundary oak, under whose
umbrageous shade Queen Elizabeth is said to have
dined. <b>Nunhead</b> derived its name from “The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Nuns’ Head,” a place of holiday resort for
Londoners, dating back more than two hundred
years. <b>Peckham</b> was originally <i>Beckham</i>, a
home distinguished for its becks or brooks.
<b>Brixton</b> is a corruption of the Anglo-Saxon
“Brigestan,” the bridge of stone. <b>Camberwell</b>
derived its name from a miraculous well discovered
close by the parish church dedicated to St. Giles,
the patron of cripples. <i>Cam</i> is Celtic for crooked.
In this instance the word applies to the cripples,
or rather to their patron saint. [On the other hand,
the University town of <span class="smcap">Cambridge</span> was so called
from the bridge over the <span class="smcap">Cam</span>, a river distinguished
for its winding course.] <b>Stockwell</b> is in allusion to
the well found in the <i>stoc</i>, or wooded place, in Anglo-Saxon
times. <b>Kennington</b> means a settlement in
the King’s meadow. One of the palaces of Henry
VIII. stood here. <b>Newington</b> denotes the new
town in the meadow. Finally, the name of <b>St.
George’s Fields</b> was derived from the neighbouring
church of St. George the Martyr.</p>

<h2 id="BATTLES"><i>BATTLES.</i></h2>

<p><b>The Tearless Victory</b> was the name given
by Plutarch to the victory won by Archimadus,
King of Sparta, over the Argives and
Arcadians in the year 367 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> without the loss of a
single Spartan soldier. <b>The Thundering Legion</b>
is the historical designation given to the Roman
legion that overthrew the Alemanni in the year
179 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, during a thunderstorm, which was supposed
to have been sent in answer to the prayers offered up
by the Christians. Not only did the storm strike
terror into the minds of their enemies, but it also
enabled the Romans to relieve their long-protracted
thirst. <b>The Hallelujah Victory</b> received its name
from the battle-cry of the newly-baptized Bretons,
who were led to the attack by Germanus, Bishop of
Auxerre, in the year 429.</p>

<p><b>The Battle of the Standard</b>, fought between the
English and the Scots at Northallerton, August 29,
1138, was so called because the standard of the former
consisted of a tall crucifix borne upon a wagon. From
the crucifix itself there was suspended the Consecrated
Host enclosed in a pyx, while floating beneath were
the bannerets of SS. Peter, Wilfrid, and John of
Beverley. <b>The Battle of the Herrings</b> (February<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
12, 1429) obtained its title from the defeat
suffered by the Duc de Bourbon when attempting to
intercept a convoy of salted herrings on their way
to the English besieging Orleans. <b>The Battle of
Spurs</b> is the more familiar designation of the Battle
of Guinnegate, in which Henry VIII. defeated the
Duc de Longueville (August 16, 1513), because the
French were said to have used their spurs more
than their swords. This event, however, must not
be confounded with <b>The Battle of the Spurs of
Gold</b>, which took place between the French and
the Flemish at Courtray, in Belgium, July 11, 1302.
In this engagement the French were completely
routed, and the spurs of upwards of eight thousand
of the vanquished knights were left upon the field.
These were collected and preserved as trophies of
war in the Church of Notre Dame de Courtray.</p>

<p>The Battle of Marignano (September 13, 1515)
also bears the name of <b>The Battle of the Giants</b>,
owing to the defeat by Francis I., King of France, of
1,200 Swiss Guards, the allies of the Milanese. The
Battle of Leipsic (October 16-18, 1813) is known
as <b>The Battle of All the Nations</b>, because, in
addition to signalizing the overthrow of Napoleon
and the deliverance of Germany, it was the champion
battle of the nations of Europe.</p>

<h2 id="NOTABLE_DAYS_AND_FESTIVALS"><i>NOTABLE DAYS AND FESTIVALS.</i></h2>

<p>That <b>New Year’s Day</b> is the first day of
the recurring year goes without saying.
Previous to 1752, when the year commenced
on the 25th of March, its four recognized quarters
were Whitsuntide, Lammastide, Martinmastide, and
Candlemastide; at the present time they are Lady
Day, Midsummer, Michaelmas, and Christmas. Let
us at once consider the meaning of these terms.</p>

<p><b>Whitsuntide</b> is the season ushered in by <b>Whit
Sunday</b>, a corruption of <b>White Sunday</b>, because,
during the primitive ages of the Church, all newly-baptized
persons were required to attend Mass in
white garments on this day. As every one knows,
Whit Sunday commemorates the descent of the Holy
Spirit upon the Apostles in the form of fiery tongues.
It is highly probable, therefore, that the true meaning
of Whit, or White, Sunday remains to be sought
in connection with the wisdom symbolized by these
fiery tongues. After all, the original spelling of this
festival-name may have been Witan Sunday, the
Anglo-Saxon for Wisdom Sunday; just as the earliest
English parliaments were styled <span class="smcap">Witanagemotes</span>,
or “meetings of the wise men.” But to proceed.
<b>Lammastide</b> literally signified the season of First<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Fruits; since on <b>Lammas Day</b>, a term compounded
out of the Anglo-Saxon <i>hlaf</i>, a loaf, and <i>mœsse</i>, a
feast, (Aug. 1st), it was formerly the custom to offer
bread made of new wheat in the churches. <b>Martinmas
Day</b> (Nov. 4th), latterly corrupted into <b>Martlemas
Day</b>, denotes the Feast of St. Martin, Bishop
of Tours in the fourth century. <b>Candlemas Day</b>,
or the <b>Feast of the Purification</b> (Feb. 2nd),
which commemorates the presentation of the Infant
in the Temple in accordance with the Jewish Law
instituted 1490 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, because the early Christians
walked in procession to Mass with lighted candles in
their hands on this day. This religious observance
was introduced by Pope Gelasius in the fifth century,
as a literal bearing out of the words spoken by Holy
Simeon when he took the child Jesus in his arms:
“Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace,
according to Thy word; For mine eyes have seen Thy
salvation, which Thou hast prepared before the face
of all people: <i>A light to lighten the Gentiles</i>, and the
glory of Thy people Israel” (<i>Luke</i> ii. 29-32). It is
still the practice in the Roman Catholic Church to
make offerings of candles for the use of the altar on
this day. <b>Lady Day</b> (Mar. 25th) is but another
name for the <b>Feast of the Annunciation</b>, or the
day upon which “the angel of the Lord appeared unto
Mary,” and announced that she was to become the
Mother of the Son of God. <b>Midsummer Day</b> (June
24th) expresses the midday of the year; while <b>Michaelmas
Day</b> (Sept. 29th) is the Feast of St. Michael,
the patron saint of the Roman Catholic Church. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the latter feast falls upon the first day of autumn,
the hiring of labourers and domestics in the rural
districts takes place at this time. <b>Christmas
Day</b> is, to put it literally, the Feast Day of Christ,
being the anniversary of the Nativity of the Blessed
Redeemer.</p>

<p><b>Innocents’ Day</b>, formerly known as <b>Childermas
Day</b> (Dec. 28th), commemorates the Massacre of
the Innocents by Herod. <b>Twelfth Day</b> (Jan. 6th),
signifying the twelfth day after Christmas Day, bears
the ecclesiastical name of the <b>Epiphany</b>, from the
Greek <i>Epiphaneia</i>, a showing or appearance, because
on this day the Infant manifested Himself to the
Three Wise Men from the East who came to adore
Him. In olden times the Feast of the Epiphany
was kept with great solemnity in the churches during
the day, followed by a festival of a more social
character in the evening, thus accounting for the
old-fashioned appellation of <b>Twelfth Night</b>. The
7th of January was formerly called <b>Distaff’s Day</b>,
because the Christmas festivities having come
to an end with Twelfth Night, the women were
expected to return to their distaffs and other regular
occupations on this day. Another name for the
same occasion was <b>Rock Day</b>, <i>rock</i> being the Anglo-Saxon
term for a distaff. Similarly, the first Monday
after the Epiphany bore the designation of <b>Plough
Monday</b>, on account of the men returning to the
plough and the ordinary labours of the field on this
day. <b>Handsel Monday</b>, the first Monday in the
New Year, was so called by the Anglo-Saxons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
because then it was that <i>handsels</i>, or presents, were
bestowed upon domestics and children. To the
best of our knowledge the custom no longer
exists in any portion of this country; or perhaps
it may be more correct to say that its observance
has been universally transferred to <b>Boxing
Day</b> (Dec. 26th), originally so styled from the
opening of the various alms-boxes in the churches,
and the distribution of their contents, which bore
the name of a <b>Christmas Dole</b>, to the poor by the
clergy on this day. Moreover, since heads of families
usually gave their children and domestics small sums
of money to drop into the boxes for the latter purpose
on Christmas morning, we here trace the origin of
the term <b>Christmas Box</b>, which nowadays applies
to a present received by servants and others during
the Christmas season.</p>

<p>The word <b>Lent</b> is a contraction of the Old English
<i>lenten</i>, and the Anglo-Saxon <i>lencten</i>, the spring, both
derived from <i>lencgan</i>, to lengthen, because the long
fast of the Christian Church occurs when the days
begin to lengthen. <b>Shrove Tuesday</b>, also known
as <b>Pancake Tuesday</b>, derived its name from the
shriving or confessing imposed upon the faithful on
this day. The custom of eating pancakes originated
from the fact that this species of food afforded a stay
to the appetite during the long hours of waiting in
church to be shrived. The distribution of ashes on
<b>Ash Wednesday</b> commemorates the passage in
the third chapter of <i>Genesis</i>, where the Lord curses
Adam in these words: “In the sweat of thy face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
thou shalt eat bread till thou return to the ground;
for dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return.”
<b>Passion Sunday</b>, which precedes Palm Sunday, is
devoted to a general commemoration of the subject
of Christ’s Passion. <b>Palm Sunday</b> owes its name
to the distribution of palms in the Roman Catholic
Church, in allusion to the palms borne by the
populace who accompanied the Redeemer into
Jerusalem shortly before His betrayal by Judas. The
week following Palm Sunday is called <b>Passion
Week</b>, and also <b>Holy Week</b>, because it contains
the days upon which the incidents of Christ’s Passion
are particularly commemorated. <b>Maunday Thursday</b>
is the first, not at all on account of the <i>maund</i>,
the Saxon term for an alms-basket, formerly presented
to the poor by the Lord (or rather by the
Lady, “the loaf-giver”) of the Manor, but from the
ancient ceremony of washing the feet of poor persons,
in imitation of Christ at the Last Supper, when He
said, “Mandatum novum do vobis,” &amp;c., the French
for <i>Mandatum</i> being <i>Maundé</i>. The ecclesiastical designation
of this day is <b>Holy Thursday</b>, in commemoration
of the Agony and Bloody Sweat of the
Saviour in the Garden of Gethsemane. <b>Good Friday</b>,
the anniversary of the Crucifixion, was originally
known as “God’s Friday.” The Anglo-Saxons usually
called this day <b>Long Friday</b>, in consequence of the
length of the Church service. <b>Holy Saturday</b> is
the day upon which the Church commemorates the
Burial of Christ.</p>

<p>The word <b>Easter</b> bears in itself no Christian
significance whatever, having been derived from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
<i>Eoster</i>, the goddess of light, or spring, in whose
honour a festival was anciently held in the month
of April. The Jewish festival corresponding to our
Easter is called the <b>Passover</b>, in commemoration
of the Destroying Angel having <i>passed over</i> the
houses of the Israelites whose door-posts were
marked with the blood of a lamb killed the previous
night in accordance with the Divine command, when
He smote the firstborn of the Egyptians in the year
1491 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> Returning to the Christian Church, the
Sunday after Easter is called <b>Low Sunday</b>, because
it stands at the bottom of the Lenten Calendar;
being the last day upon which Roman Catholics may
fulfil their Easter obligation of receiving the Holy
Communion. <b>Sexagesima Sunday</b>, <b>Quinquagesima
Sunday</b>, and <b>Quadragesima Sunday</b>
are situated in the Calendar respectively sixty, fifty,
and forty days before Easter; the terms expressing
the Latin for those round numbers.</p>

<p>The Feast of Whitsuntide, which we have already
discussed, also bears the name of <b>Pentecost</b>, from
the Greek <i>pentekoste</i>, the fiftieth day, in commemoration
of the gift of the Law to the Israelites fifty days
after their deliverance out of Egypt. <b>Trinity
Sunday</b>, so called from the Latin <i>trinitas</i>, three,
is the Festival of the Holy Trinity, <i>i.e.</i>, the unity
of the three persons, the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Ghost, under one Godhead. <b>Corpus Christi</b>
expresses the Latin for the Body of Christ, especially
alluding to the Last Supper. As the Church considered
it out of keeping with the solemnity peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
to Holy Week, the celebration of this High Festival
has been transferred to the Thursday after Trinity
Sunday. The Sunday preceding Ascension Day is
called <b>Rogation Sunday</b> because it ushers in the
three <b>Rogation Days</b>, or days of preparation, conformably
to the Latin <i>rogare</i>, to beseech, for the
Feast of the Ascension. We may conveniently add
here that <b>Ember Days</b> are those days of especial
fasting and prayers that occur in each of the four
seasons of the year, viz., the Wednesday, Thursday,
and Saturday after the first Sunday in Lent, and the
corresponding three days after the Feast of Whitsuntide,
the 14th of September, and the 13th of
December. The weeks in which these days occur
are styled <b>Ember Weeks</b>; the allusion to embers
(Anglo-Saxon, <i>ämyrie</i>, hot ashes) being commemorative
of the ancient custom of doing penance by the
wearing of sackcloth and ashes.</p>

<p>On <b>Ascension Day</b> the Church celebrates the
Ascension of our Saviour; while the <b>Feast of the
Assumption</b> similarly reminds Roman Catholics of
the consummation of the Virgin’s mission upon earth
by being assumed into Heaven. <b>Holy Cross Day</b>,
<b>Holy Rood Day</b>, and the <b>Feast of the Exaltation
of the Cross</b> are one and the same, the term
Rood being Old English, derived from the Anglo-Saxon
<i>rôd</i>, for cross. This festival, which occurs on
the 14th of September, celebrates the restoration of
the Holy Cross of Calvary to Jerusalem in the year
628. <b>All Saints’ Day</b> (Nov. 1st), is the day dedicated
to those whose sanctification during life merited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
their canonization by the Church after death; while
<b>All Souls’ Day</b> (Nov. 2nd) is the day set apart for
special prayers, having for their object the liberation
of the suffering souls in Purgatory. The older designation
of the first-named was <b>Allhallowes Day</b>, in
accordance with the Anglo-Saxon word <i>haligan</i>, holy.
<b>Allhallowe’en</b> denoted the evening before, generally
attended with sundry amusements in the social circle;
conspicuous among which was the cracking of nuts
in large quantities in the fire, whence it received the
name of <b>Cracknut Night</b>.</p>

<p><b>St. Valentine’s Day</b> (Feb. 14th) is sacred to the
memory of Bishop Valentine, a Christian martyr
beheaded at Rome on this day in the year 278. The
custom among young people of sending poetical
souvenirs to their sweethearts on the birthday of St.
Valentine originated from the old notion that birds
commenced to couple on this day: hence, a sweetheart
chosen on the 14th of February anciently bore
the name of a <span class="smcap">Valentine</span>. Nowadays, alas! the
paper <span class="smcap">Valentines</span> are all that remain to remind us
of the fact. <b>St. Swithin’s Day</b> (July 15th) perpetuates
the memory of St. Swithin, the preceptor of
King Ethelwulf and Bishop of Winchester, who
died July 2, 862. The vulgar belief that if it rains
on this day it will continue to rain for forty successive
days is attributed to the tradition that when, despite
the saint’s dying request to be buried in the churchyard,
the clergy took steps to disinter his body in
order to remove it within the cathedral, a heavy
downpour of rain necessitated a postponement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
their efforts on thirty-nine successive days, whereupon,
after the fortieth attempt, they determined to
allow the saint to remain where he lay. <b>St. David’s
Day</b> (Mar. 1st) commemorates the victory won by
the Welsh over the Saxons on the birthday of their
Archbishop (born 490, died 554), in the year 540. It
was in consequence of the Archbishop having ordered
them on this occasion to place a leek in their caps, so
as to distinguish one another from the invaders, that
the Welsh afterwards adopted the leek as their
national emblem in his honour. <b>Comb’s Mass</b>,
which in the north of Scotland, and Caithness more
particularly, takes the place of our Whitsuntide, is
the colloquial term for the Feast of St. Columba,
Abbot of Iona (born 521, died 597).</p>

<p><b>Primrose Day</b> (April 19th) is the anniversary of
the death of Lord Beaconsfield (born 1804, died 1881).
The abundant display of primroses on this day, particularly
on the part of the members of the Primrose
League, established in 1884 in his honour, originated
in the Queen’s primrose wreath sent to the funeral of
the great statesman, thus inscribed&mdash;“His favourite
flower.” The custom of displaying a sprig of oak on
<b>Royal Oak Day</b> (May 29th) perpetuates the manner
in which the Royalists welcomed the return to England
of Charles II. on his birthday, May 29, 1651,
in allusion to his concealment in the oak at Boscobel,
after the Battle of Worcester, on the 3rd of September
previous. <b>Guy Fawkes’ Day</b> keeps alive the
incident of the Gunpowder Plot, by the timely discovery
of which, November 5, 1605, the wholesale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
destruction of King James’s Parliament was averted.
The name of the chief conspirator was not Guy, but
Guido Fawkes; his execution took place January 13,
1606.</p>

<p><b>Arbor Day</b> is an expression scarcely understood
in this country, except, perhaps, at Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
where the Transatlantic ceremony of planting
trees, shrubs, and flowers within the school precincts,
was publicly performed for the first time by the Mayor,
June 11, 1888. This annual observance prevails not
only throughout the United States and Canada, but
also in certain portions of British Columbia, where
the trees have to be coaxed into growing. <b>Forefathers’
Day</b> (Dec. 20th) is kept as a high holiday
in New England, commemorative of the landing of
the Pilgrim Fathers at New Plymouth in the year
1620. <b>Independence Day</b> (July 4th), perpetuates
the memory of the American Declaration of Independence,
1776; and <b>Evacuation Day</b> (Nov. 25th),
the date of the evacuation of New York City by the
British army, at the conclusion of the American
War of Independence, 1783.</p>

<p>The Sunday in Mid-Lent when the Pope blesses
the Golden Rose, and children and domestics out at
service visit their mothers to feast upon <span class="smcap">Mothering
Cakes</span>, really owes its name of <b>Mothering Sunday</b>
to the ancient custom of making offerings to “Mother
Church” on the afternoon of this day. <b>St. Grouse’s
Day</b> is a popular nickname given to the 12th of
August (<b>Grouse Day</b>), when grouse shooting
commences; and <b>St. Partridge’s Day</b>, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
1st of September (<b>Partridge Day</b>), which
opens the season for partridge shooting; while
<b>Sprat Day</b> (Nov. 9th) is the first day for selling
sprats in London. The expression <b>Red Letter
Day</b>, signifying a past event generally referred to
with pleasure, found its origin in the old almanacks,
where the Festivals and Saints’ Days were printed
in red ink and the rest in black. This arrangement
still obtains in Roman Catholic countries.</p>

<p><b>Holiday</b> is a corruption of Holy Day, or a day
originally set apart by the Roman Catholic Church
for the celebration of some feast in commemoration
of an important event, or in honour of a particular
saint. The word <b>Almanac</b>, also written
<b>Almanack</b>, is derived from the Arabic <i>al manah</i>,
to count; whereas <b>Calendar</b> is a contraction of the
Latin <i>calendarium</i>, an account-book.</p>

<h2 id="TEXTILES_EMBROIDERIES_AND"><i>TEXTILES, EMBROIDERIES, AND
LACE.</i></h2>

<p>Several of our textile fabrics are indebted for
their names to the places where they were
first manufactured. As examples: <b>Damask
Linens and Silks</b> originally came from Damascus;
<b>Muslin</b> from Moosul, in Mesopotamia; <b>Nankeen</b>
from Nankin, in China; <b>Calico</b> from Calicut, on
the Malabar Coast; <b>Cashmere</b> from the valley of
Cashmere, in India; <b>Dimity</b> from Damietta, in
Egypt; <b>Valence</b> from Valencia, in Spain; and
<b>Holland</b> from the Netherlands. <b>Cambric</b> was
first made at Cambray; <b>Shalloon</b> at Chalons; and
<b>Tarlatan</b> at Tarare: each of these towns being
situated in France. <b>Worsted</b> formerly comprised
the staple industry of a town of that name in
Norfolk; <b>Cobourg</b> is brought from Cobourg, in
Germany; while <b>Angola</b> comes from the Portuguese
territory so called on the West Coast of
Africa. The coarse woollen cloth known as <b>Frieze</b>
was originally imported from Friesland.</p>

<p>The name of <b>Cotton</b> is a modification of the
Arabic <i>qoton</i>; <b>Silk</b> is derived from the Latin
<i>sericus</i>, soft; and <b>Satin</b> from the Italian <i>seta</i>, a
species of silk distinguished for its gloss and close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
texture. Variegated silk or other stuff bears the
name of <b>Brocade</b> in accordance with the Italian
verb <i>broccare</i>, to prick, to stitch, to figure; <b>Damassin</b>
is a damask cloth interwoven with flowers, or
silver, or gold; <b>Sarsanet</b> is a fine silk, originally
made by the Saracens; <b>Mohair</b> is properly Moorhair,
or the hair of the Angola goat introduced into
Spain by the Moors; whereas <b>Moire Antique</b> is
the French description of a watered silk worked up
in the manner of that worn in the olden time.
<b>Chintz</b> is a Persian word signifying spotted or
stained; <b>Taffety</b>, or <b>Taffeta</b>, is a modification of
the Persian <i>tâftah</i>, derived from <i>taftan</i>, to spin; <b>Linen</b>
is an Anglo-Saxon rendering of the Latin <i>linum</i>,
flax; and <b>Lawn</b> is simply fine linen bleached upon
a lawn instead of the customary drying-ground.
<b>Pompadour</b> received its name from Madame le
Pompadour, the mistress of Louis XV. of France
(born 1721, died 1764), who was the first to introduce
it.</p>

<p><b>Swansdown</b> is, of course, made from the down
of swans; <b>Moleskin</b> is not the skin of the mole,
but a strong cotton fabric or fustain having a smooth
surface like the mole-skin; <b>Merino</b> is manufactured
from the wool of the Merino sheep; and <b>Alpaca</b>
from that of the alpaca, a species of <i>llama</i> found in
Peru. <b>Kersey</b> is a corruption of <b>Jersey</b>, indicative
of the place where this favourite woollen material
was first produced. The dyed cotton stuff known
as <b>Gingham</b>, out of which umbrellas were formerly
made&mdash;hence the slang term for those articles&mdash;is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
so called after the native Javanese name pronounced
ginggang. We may also conveniently add here that
<b>Blankets</b> received their designation from Thomas
Blanket, who first made them at Bristol as long ago
as the year 1340.</p>

<p>The name of <b>Velvet</b> traces its origin from the
Latin <i>villus</i>, shaggy hair; and <b>Plush</b> from <i>pilus</i>, a
hair. <b>Velveteen</b> is a cotton velvet or a cloth in
imitation of velvet. <b>Fustian</b>, derived from the
Spanish <i>fustan</i>, is a generic term for the twilled
cotton stuffs of which velvet, corduroy, &amp;c., are the
chief. <b>Grogram</b> is a corruption of the French
<i>gros-grain</i>, meaning coarse-grained; whereas <b>Corduroy</b>
is properly <i>Cord du roy</i>, King’s Cord, so called
because, owing to its ribbed or corded surface, it
was at one time considered superior to any other
kind of cloth intended for masculine wear. <b>Pina-cloth</b>,
a material much used for ladies’ dresses,
is manufactured from the fibres of the pine-apple
leaf; just as <b>Grass-cloth</b> is extensively worked up
into light jackets for Indian wear from the Grass
Cloth plant which abounds in China, Assam, and
Sumatra. <b>T-cloth</b> comprises a special kind of
cloth expressly manufactured in this country for
exportation to India, and distinguished by a <i>T</i>
marked upon it; while <b>Broadcloth</b> simply bears
its name on account of its unusual width. The
name of <b>Twill</b> is a modification of the German
<i>Zwillich</i>, signifying trellis-work, and founded upon
<i>twillen</i>, to separate in two, since this cloth presents
the appearance of diagonal lines or ribs upon its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
surface. <b>Tweed</b> is a cloth made in the neighbourhood
of the river Tweed; but it did not always bear
this name. The cloth is really <i>twill</i>, and the altered
designation arose out of the word being blotted in an
invoice sent to James Locke, of London, who, conceiving
it to look like “Tweed,” suggested that it
might as well stand for the name of the cloth as
any other. <b>Plaid</b> owes its name to the Gaelic
<i>peallaid</i>, a sheepskin out of which the over-garments
of the Highlanders were originally made.
<b>Check</b> is but another name for Plaid, meaning
checkered, <i>i.e.</i>, marked with variegated or crossed
lines; as, for example, a draught-board, of which the
counters are, on account of their cross movements,
called <span class="smcap">Checkers</span> or <span class="smcap">Chequers</span>.</p>

<p>The word <b>Embroidery</b> is a modern substantive
evolved out of the old verb “Embordering,” by
which was meant the adornment of any material
with a border. <b>Tapestry</b> is derived, through the
French <i>tapisserie</i>, from the Latin <i>tapes</i>, a carpet.
The celebrated <b>Bayeaux Tapestry</b>, supposed to
have been the work of Matilda, queen of William
the Conqueror, and her maidens, took its name from
the Norman town where it was discovered in 1728.
<b>Gobelin Tapestry</b> preserves the memory of the
Brothers Gobelin, the great French dyers (flourished
1470) whose house in Paris was acquired in 1662
by Louis XIV. for the production of tapestry and
other works of ornamental design suitable for the
adornment of palaces under the direction of M.
Colbert. The more ancient name for Tapestry was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
that of Arras, in allusion to the town situated in
the French Netherlands whence it chiefly came.</p>

<p>Having regard to Lace, it will suffice to observe
that <b>Lisle</b>, <b>Chantilly</b>, <b>Brussells</b>, <b>Honiton</b>, &amp;c.,
severally identify the Lace with the local centres
where its manufacture is principally carried on;
that <b>Valenciennes</b> is made at Valenciennes, in
France; and that <b>Colbertine</b> derives its name from
M. Colbert, the superintendent of the French Royal
Lace Factories established by Louis XIV. in the
seventeenth century. Lace is styled <b>Point-lace</b>
when it is worked with the point of a needle; and
<b>Pillow-lace</b> when produced by twisted threads
around a series of pins arranged on a cushion.
The latter, which has so greatly superseded the
more costly point-lace, is said to have been the
invention of Barbara Uttmann, of St. Annaberg, in
the year 1561. The word <b>Lace</b> itself comes from
the Latin <i>laques</i>, a noose or snare. <b>Tulle</b>, a species
of network or lace, is indebted for its designation
to the French town of that name where it was first
made.</p>

<h2 id="LITERARY_PSEUDONYMS"><i>LITERARY PSEUDONYMS.</i></h2>

<p>So far from being chosen at random these are
frequently the result of much premeditation.
<b>Voltaire</b> (born 1694, died 1778), whose proper
name was Arovet, composed out of this and the
initials L. I. (<i>le jeune</i>) the anagram by which all his
writings are identified. Again, <b>Barry Cornwall</b> is
an imperfect anagram founded upon Bryan Waller
Procter (born 1790, died 1874), the poet’s real
name; whereas <b>Yendys</b>, the signature of Sydney
Dobell (born 1824, died 1874), was merely the
Christian name reversed. To cite an instance of
another class: Charles James Apperley, of Denbighshire,
author of “The Chase, the Turf, and the
Road,” and a regular contributor to <i>The Quarterly
Review</i> could scarcely have hit upon a more fitting
pseudonym than that of <b>Nimrod</b>, who “was a
mighty hunter before the Lord,” alluded to in
<i>Genesis</i> x. 9. Such a choice will be the better
understood, perhaps, when it is mentioned that out
of regard for the sporting tastes of his esteemed
contributor, Mr. Pittman, the proprietor of the
<i>Quarterly</i> kept a stud of hunters for his especial
use. Equally appropriate was the pseudonym
<b>Zadkiel</b>, denoting the angel of the planet Jupiter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
adopted by Lieutenant Richard James Morrison,
author of “The Prophetic Almanack,” which still
survives as an annual publication.</p>

<p>Washington Irving selected the <i>nom de plume</i> of
<b>Knickerbocker</b> for his “History of New York,” in
allusion to the wide breeches worn by the original
settlers of that city. The true account of how
Charles Lamb (born 1775, died 1834) adopted the
name of <b>Elia</b> for his “Essays” is as follows:&mdash;His
first contribution to the “London Magazine”
being a description of the Old South Sea House, in
which he had spent several months of his noviciate
as a clerk, he at the very moment of appending his
signature, bethought himself of a gay, light-hearted
foreigner who used to flutter about there; and, as a
mere matter of whim, he wrote down the name of
that individual instead of his own. <b>Boz</b>, the early
<i>nom de plume</i> of Charles Dickens (born 1812, died
1870), arose out of the nickname of Moses conferred
by him upon a younger pet brother in honour of
Moses Primrose in the “Vicar of Wakefield.” The
other children of the family, however, found it
impossible to utter a nearer pronunciation to the
name than “Bozes,” which presently became
shortened in “Boz”; and the latter hit the fancy
of our young author sufficiently to lead him to its
adoption at that period of his literary career when
he lacked the confidence to appear before the world
under his own name. Out of an analogous incident
sprang <b>Ouida</b>, the pseudonym of one of the most
widely-read lady novelists of the present day. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
actual name is Louise de la Ramée (born in 1840);
but remarking the infantile conversion of Louise
into “Ouida,” she was struck by the novelty of such
a <i>nom de plume</i>, and immediately adopted it.
Another lady novelist of probably higher attainments
assumed the name of <b>George Sand</b> (born
1804, died 1876) as the outcome of her attachment
to a young student named Jules Sand, or rather
Sandeau, with whom she collaborated in the production
of “Rose et Blanche,” her first novel. The
real name of this lady was Mdlle. Dupin, afterwards
changed by marriage to Madame Dudevant.</p>

<p>It may be deemed interesting to learn also that
<b>Artemus Ward</b> was an actual name borne by an
eccentric showman with whom Charles Farrar
Browne, the American humorist (born 1834, died
1867) often came into personal contact; and,
further, that Samuel Langhorne Clemens (born in
1835) owes his singular pseudonym to the fact of
having been employed in early life as a pilot on one
of the Mississippi River steamboats. The nautical
phrase for taking soundings, <b>Mark Twain</b>, or, in
other words, “mark two fathoms,” suggested the
name under which the works of the latter have
become widely popular on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Finally, not every one is aware that <b>F. M. Allen</b>,
the pseudonym of Mr. Edmund Downey, author of
“The Voyage of the Ark,” “Through Green Glasses,”
and some other books of Irish humour, was his wife’s
maiden name.</p>

<p>A <b>Portrait</b>, so called from the Latin <i>protrahere</i>,
to draw forth, is produced by the
individual skill of an artist; whereas a
<b>Photograph</b>, conformably to the two Greek words
<i>photos</i>, light, and <i>graphein</i>, to write, is obtained by
the action of sunlight upon a chemically prepared
surface, such as silver, zinc, copper, glass, or paper.</p>

<p>The earliest examples of portraiture were styled
<b>Miniatures</b> because they originated from the head
of the Virgin or of some well-known saint introduced
into the initial letters of illuminated rubics
by the <i>Miniatori</i>, a number of monks noted for
their skill in painting with <i>minium</i>, or red lead.
The reason why the portraits of monarchs are
represented on coins and medals in <b>Profile</b> dates
back to Antigonus, one of the generals of Alexander
the Great, who, having lost one eye, ordered his
likeness to be drawn from a side view. This
occurred in the year 330 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> The term is a
corruption, by way of the French <i>profil</i>, of the
Latin <i>perfilum</i>, compounded out of <i>per</i>, through, by,
and <i>filum</i>, a line, a thread. A profile cut out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
black paper bears the name of a <b>Silhouette</b> in
honour of Etienne de Silhouette, the French Comptroller
of Finance under Louis XV. (born 1709,
died 1767), who was the first to have his features
outlined in this manner.</p>

<p>The earlier descriptions of photographs were
respectively styled <b>Talbotypes</b>, <b>Daguerreotypes</b>,
and <b>Ferriertypes</b>, after the names of their inventors.
The smaller-sized photographs at present
in use were originally described as <b>Cartes-de-Visite</b>
from the practice of the Duc de Parma, who, while
staying at Nice in the year 1857, had his photograph
produced on the back of his visiting cards. The
designation <b>Vignette</b>, which expresses the French
diminutive of vine or tendril, owes its origin to the
vine-leaves or branches that properly surround the
photographs produced in this style. A photograph of
the larger size is called a <b>Cabinet</b> because it forms
a picture suited to the walls of a cabinet or very
small room. A three-quarter-length photograph or
portrait is styled among artists a <b>Kit-Kat</b>, in
allusion to the portraits of the original members
of the “Kit-Kat Club,” which were painted by Sir
Godfrey Kneller for Jacob Tonson, the secretary, to
suit the dimensions of the room in which the Club
was latterly held at his villa at Barn Elms.
Similarly, a canvas measuring 28 inches by 36
inches is styled a <b>Kit-Kat Canvas</b> because this
was the uniform size of the famous “Kit-Kat Club
portraits.” We may as well add here that the
<span class="smcap">Kit-Kat Club</span> derived its name from Christopher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Kat, a pastrycook of King Street, Westminster, in
whose house the thirty noblemen and gentlemen
who formed themselves into a Club for the purpose
of promoting the Protestant Succession in the year
1703 held their first meetings.</p>

<p>In our article on <a href="#TAVERN_SIGNS"><span class="smcap">Tavern Signs</span></a> we confined ourselves
to a general survey of the subject; we
now purpose to consider the significance of a
few Inn Signs that are, or were once, peculiar to
London. Commencing with the celebrated <b>Tabard</b>,
in Southwark, so dear to the memory of Chaucer
and his Canterbury Pilgrims, that sign was derived
from the rich tunic or mantle of the same name
worn by military nobles over their armour and
emblazoned with heraldic devices. The Tabard
still forms part of the costume of the heralds. <b>La
Belle Sauvage</b>, on Ludgate Hill, was, as is evident
from a legal document dated the thirty-first year of
the reign of Henry VI., known both as “Savage’s
Inn” and “The Bell and the Hoop.” The latter
was the actual sign, representing a bell within a
hoop, of the Inn which was kept by Isabelle
Savage; and the combination of these two names
resulted in the punning title of “La Belle Sauvage.”
<b>The Swan with Two Necks</b>, in Lad Lane, was
a corruption of “The Swan with Two Nicks.” As
most Londoners are aware, it has long been the
custom of the Vintners’ Company, in their annual
“swan-upping” expeditions on the Thames, to mark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
their swans with a couple of nicks or notches in the
bill, so as to distinguish them from the royal swans,
whose nicks are five in number, viz., two lengthways
and three across on the bill. That this characteristic
mark of the Vintners’ Company should have
been chosen for a London Inn Sign is scarcely
extraordinary.</p>

<p>The sign of <b>The Elephant and Castle</b>, on the
south side of the river, was adopted from the crest
of the Cutlers’ Company, into whose trade ivory,
and consequently elephants’ tusks, enters very considerably.
With regard to the “Castle,” this was
in mediæval times inseparable from the idea of an
elephant, owing to the part which these huge
animals anciently took in the Punic wars. Another
“Elephant and Castle” exists in the parish of
St. Pancras, near King’s Cross; but this sign
originated from the discovery, in 1714, of the
skeleton of an elephant in the neighbourhood of
Battle Bridge. A flint-headed spear lay beside the
remains, and from this it is reasonable to conjecture
that the animal must have been killed by the Britons
who were led by Queen Boadicea against the Romans
in the year 61 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span></p>

<p><b>The Horse Shoe</b>, Tottenham Court Road, came
into existence as a sign from the large horse-shoes
nailed up at the entrance of Messrs. Meux’s brewery
adjoining. The shoes are also conspicuous on the
trappings of the dray-horses belonging to that
establishment; in short, they comprise the trade-mark
of the firm. <b>The Blue Posts</b>, at the corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
of Hanway Street, nearly opposite the “Horse
Shoe,” arose out of the fancy of an old innkeeper
to distinguish his hostelry from all others by causing
the chain-posts abutting on the road to be painted
blue instead of white, which eccentricity fully served
the purpose of a sign. There is another “Blue
Posts” in Cork Street, Piccadilly, and yet another
in Southampton Buildings, Holborn; but the first-named
is the oldest of the three, and therefore the
original. <b>The Black Posts</b>, Bond Street, may
also be regarded as a modified imitation of the
example set by the original “Blue Posts.” <b>The
Three Chairmen</b>, at the foot of Hay Hill, Berkeley
Square, and <b>The Running Footman</b>, in Hayes’
Mews, close by, were so denominated from being
the resort of gentlemen’s servants in the days when
<span class="smcap">Sedan Chairs</span> (these chairs were first made at
Sedan, in France, which accounts for their name,
exactly as <span class="smcap">Bath Chairs</span> were originally introduced
at Bath during the last century, when fashionable
invalids flocked to the West of England to drink the
Bath and Cheltenham waters) and Running Footmen
preceded the use of private carriages by the
wealthy.</p>

<p><b>The Mother Red Cap</b>, Camden Town, perpetuates
the memory of a notorious poisoner known
as “Mother Damnable, the Consort of the Devil,”
who lived at Hungerford Stairs during the period of
the Commonwealth. <b>The Mother Shipton</b>, Haverstock
Hill, was built at the time when the prophecies
of Mrs. Evan Preece, of Glamorganshire, South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Wales, were in everybody’s mouth. This old woman
was said to have had a son by the devil, whereupon,
in return for the sacrifice of her honour, she was
accorded the gift of prophecy. When we state that
she correctly predicted the deaths of Lord Percy,
Wolsey, and other historical personages, the existence
of Mother Shipton in this country must be
regarded as a time-honoured if not exactly as a
well-founded institution. <b>The Adelaide</b>, Haverstock
Hill, was named in honour of the consort of
William IV., and <b>The York and Albany</b> after the
title of Frederick, the second son of George III.</p>

<p><b>Jack Straw’s Castle</b>, Highbury, as also the
celebrated hostelry of the same name on Hampstead
Heath, was so called after Jack Straw, one of the
leaders in Wat Tyler’s insurrection, who pulled
down the Priory of the Knights of St. John of
Jerusalem at the former place, and whose habitation
was a hole formed out of the hill-side on the
site of the present Inn at the latter place. <b>The
Spaniards</b>, Highgate, was originally the private
residence of the Spanish Ambassador to James I.
<b>The Whittington Stone</b>, Highgate Hill, took its
sign from the stone upon which the world-famous
Dick Whittington sat down to rest the while he
listened to the bells of Bow Church pleasantly
chiming across the open fields. The stone is still
to be seen on the edge of the pavement exactly
opposite the public-house.</p>

<p>The sign of <b>The Thirteen Cantons</b>, King Street,
Golden Square, was adopted in compliment to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
thirteen Protestant cantons of Switzerland, and to
the numerous natives of that country who at one
time took up their residence in the parish of Soho.
During the last decade or two the Swiss population
has given way in a large degree to French immigrants.
<b>The North Pole</b>, Wardour Street, dates
back to the time when our national interest in Arctic
discovery was at its height; exactly in the same
manner as <b>The South Australian</b>, Hans Place,
Chelsea, was established in the year that first witnessed
the colonization of Southern Australia.</p>

<p><b>The World’s End</b>, in the King’s Road, Chelsea,
a favourite house of entertainment during the Restoration
period, received its name on account of its
distance from town. <b>The Fulham Bridge</b>, at
Knightsbridge, recalls the original name of the
structure which crossed the Westbourne in this
neighbourhood (<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_150"><span class="smcap">Knightsbridge</span></a>). <b>The Devil</b>,
Fleet Street, received its name from its situation,
nearly opposite the Church of St. Dunstan, and
the traditional account of that saint having seized
the Evil One by the nose with a pair of hot
pincers. <b>The Three Nuns</b>, Aldgate, well serves
the purpose of reminding us of the existence
of an ancient priory inhabited by the nuns of
St. Clare in this neighbourhood (<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_265"><span class="smcap">Minories</span></a>).
<b>The White Conduit Tavern</b>, Islington, occupies
the site of the famous old <b>White Conduit House</b>,
a popular place of resort previous to its demolition in
1849. This was the Conduit which had served the
Carthusian Friars with water from ancient times.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
The prenomen “white” applied to the house and was
derived from the appearance of its exterior. <b>The
Belvedere</b>, Pentonville Hill, originally contained a
small structure on the roof known by this name for
sitting under and enjoying the prospect across the
fields. The term <i>Belvidere</i> is Italian, signifying
“a fine prospect,” and is equally applicable to a
summer arbour and the flat roof of a house. <b>The
Clown Tavern</b>, St. John Street Road, Clerkenwell,
owes its sign to the fact that it was formerly kept by
a clown engaged at Sadler’s Wells Theatre, in its
immediate vicinity. The well-known <b>Hummuns’s
Hotel</b>, generally alluded to as <b>Hummuns’s</b>, Covent
Garden, derived this title from its erection on the
site of a <i>Hummuns</i>, the Arabic name for a sweating
bath, kept by a Mr. Small some time during the
seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Reference to the above Inns and Taverns peculiar
to London compels us almost to say a few words
concerning those popular places of outdoor resort
of which we have all read and heard so much.
<b>Sadler’s Wells</b> marks the position of an ancient
holy well whose waters were famous for working
extraordinary cures. In the year 1683, after having
been stopped up since the Reformation, a Mr. Sadler,
while digging for gravel in his garden, discovered
this well, and thereafter it bore his name. In order
to profit by the re-established fame of this well,
Sadler converted his residence into a house of entertainment
under the title of “Sadler’s Musick
House.” Here were provided tight-rope dancing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
conjuring, tumbling, and a variety of other diversions,
always accompanied by music. Sixty years
later, probably after the death of Mr. Sadler, the
property passed into the hands of Mr. Rosoman,
who turned it into a theatre, but retained the name
of the old proprietor. The present theatre was
built by Mrs. Bateman in 1879. <b>Highbury Barn</b>,
first a small ale and cake house, and afterwards a
place of public entertainment, including a theatre,
was so called from its occupying the site of a barn-like
structure originally belonging to the ancient
Priory of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem,
and left standing after the incursion of Jack Straw
and his rebellious companions [<i>see ante</i>, <a href="#Page_190"><span class="smcap">Jack
Straw’s Castle</span></a>]. <b>Vauxhall Gardens</b> derived
their title from the Hall, or Manor-house, of Jane
Vaux, which they displaced [<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_160"><span class="smcap">Vauxhall</span></a>];
<b>Ranelagh Gardens</b> occupied the site of Ranelagh
House, the seat of an Irish nobleman of that title;
while <b>Cremorne Gardens</b> were named after Thomas
Dawson, Lord Cremorne, whose town house and
grounds they covered. Whatever may have been
the moral character of these places, their removal
has had the effect of effacing one phase of Metropolitan
amusement entirely; but it has also been
instrumental in introducing another&mdash;namely, the
Music-Halls. The first London music-hall was
“The Canterbury,” Westminster Bridge Road,
which grew out of <b>The Canterbury Arms</b>,
displaying the arms of the city of Canterbury in
the year 1848.</p>

<h2 id="SOBRIQUETS_AND_NICKNAMES"><i>SOBRIQUETS AND NICKNAMES.</i></h2>

<p>The list of historical personages whose sobriquets
and nicknames are even better known
than their proper names is very large; we
must, therefore, content ourselves with a random
selection of the principal.</p>

<p>Commencing with the ladies: Ayesha (born 610,
died 677), the second and favourite wife of Mahomet,
was called <b>The Mother of Believers</b> because the
prophet styled himself “The Father of Believers.”
<b>Fair Helen</b> was the wife of Menelaos, King of
Sparta, by whose guest, Paris, the Trojan prince,
she was carried off. This incident was the immediate
cause of the famous siege of Troy which
lasted ten years. <b>Fair Rosamond</b> (died 1154)
was the mistress of Henry II., who kept her in a
secluded bower that could be approached only by a
labyrinth or maze in the neighbourhood of the royal
palace at Woodstock. One day, however, the queen
artfully discovered her way thereto by means of a
silken thread attached to the garment of the faithless
husband, after which she soon procured the
removal of her rival by poison. Joan, the wife of
Edward the Black Prince, was styled <b>The Fair
Maid of Kent</b> (died 1385) on account of her beauty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
and being the only daughter of the Earl of Kent.
<b>The Holy Maid of Kent</b> was Elizabeth Barton, a
religious enthusiast, hanged at Tyburn in 1534. A
brave, if not a beautiful, woman of historic renown
was the Countess of Dunbar and March, who, in
the year 1337, completely defied the attempt of the
Earl of Salisbury to capture Dunbar Castle during
a siege of nineteen weeks, at the end of which the
latter was forced to retire with ignominy. This
warlike heroine is generally alluded to under the
name of <b>Black Agnes</b>, in consequence of her
swarthy complexion. A less fortunate Scottish
heroine who fell at the Battle of Ancrum Moor
beside her English adversary, General Evers, whom
she had killed, was <b>Fair Maiden Lilliard</b>. She
was buried on the site of the conflict; and her
epitaph, as follows, is known to every man, woman,
and child in that part of the country:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Fair Maiden Lilliard lies under this stene,</div>
<div class="verse">Little was her stature, but great was her fame;</div>
<div class="verse">Upon the English loons she laid many thumps,</div>
<div class="verse">And when her legs were cutted off, she fought upon her stumps.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The spot where she fell still bears the name of
“Lilliard’s Edge.” Then, of course, we have the
celebrated Joan of Arc, <b>The Maid of Orleans</b>
(born 1412, burnt at the stake 1431), who placed
herself at the head of the attacking party and
effected the capture of the city of Orleans from the
English. Neither must we omit a passing allusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
to Augustine Zaragossa, better known as <b>The Maid
of Saragossa</b>, owing to the signal heroism which
she displayed during the siege of her native city in
1808-9. The Honourable Elizabeth St. Leger, the
niece of Colonel Anthony St. Leger, who founded
the Stakes named after him in connection with Doncaster
races, is known to posterity as <b>The Lady
Freemason</b>, because on one occasion she overheard
the proceedings of an assembly of Freemasons,
and, being discovered, was, as the only way of
meeting an unprecedented difficulty, duly elected a
member of the craft and initiated into its peculiar
rites and ceremonies. Madame Jenny Lind Goldschmidt
(born 1821, died 1887) was styled <b>The
Swedish Nightingale</b> on account of her vocal
genius and her birth in the city of Stockholm. The
now popular society actress, Mrs. Langtry, bears the
somewhat punning though highly complimentary
sobriquet of <b>The Jersey Lily</b>, because she was
born in Jersey and her Christian name is Lillie.</p>

<p>Heraclitus of Ephesus (flourished 500 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>) was
known as <b>The Weeping Philosopher</b>, because he
spent the latter years of his life in grieving over the
folly of men; on the other hand, Democritus of
Abdera (born 460 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, died 357 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>) merited the
surname of <b>The Laughing Philosopher</b>, because
he jeered at the feeble powers of man, whose every act
was in the hands of fate. Duns Scotus, the Scottish
schoolman (born 1272, died 1308), was styled <b>The
Subtle Doctor</b> by reason of his learning; while
St. Thomas Aquinas (born 1227, died 1274) was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
denominated <b>The Angelic Doctor</b> because he belonged
to the priesthood. <b>St. Paul of the Cross</b>
is the name by which Paul Francis (born 1694, died
1775), founder of the religious Order of the Passionists,
is best known.</p>

<p>The famous English outlaw who flourished between
the years 1180 and 1247, and whose real name
was Robert Fitz-ooth, Earl of Huntingdon, adopted
the style of <b>Robin Hood</b>, in deference to the
example set by the people of Nottinghamshire, who,
while dropping the <i>Fitz</i>, corrupted the <i>Robert</i> into
Robin and the <i>ooth</i> into Hood. <b>Little John</b> was
properly called John Little, but being a great, stalwart
fellow, the outlaw chief took a fancy to invert
his name for the sake of the contrast. We can
quite understand “the merry men of Sherwood
Forest” cultivating an objection to hard-sounding
words; therefore it could not have been long before
William Scathelocke, another prominent member of
Robin Hood’s band, found his name reduced to the
more euphonious form of <b>Will Scarlet</b>. <b>Friar
Tuck</b> was so called because his habit was <i>tucked in</i>
around the waist by a girdle.</p>

<p><b>Sixteen-string Jack</b> was the name popularly
bestowed upon Jack Rann, a notorious highwayman
hanged in 1791, owing to the sixteen tags he wore on
his breeches, eight at each knee. Another notorious
representative of the great family of Jacks, good,
bad, and otherwise, was the Marquis of Waterford,
commonly known as <b>Spring-heel Jack</b>, from his
habit of frightening people by springing upon them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
out of obscure corners after nightfall during the
early part of the present century. <b>Gentleman
Jack</b> and <b>Gentleman Smith</b> were the titles respectively
borne by John Bannister and William
Smith, both actors of the century gone by. The
former was noted for his straightforward dealings
with his fellow-men in private life, the latter for his
gentlemanly deportment on the stage.</p>

<p>Who has not heard of <b>Admirable Crichton</b>?
This extraordinary Scottish prodigy, James Crichton
(born 1560, died 1583), is said to have given such
early proofs of his learning that the degree of Master
of Arts was conferred upon him at the age of fourteen.
In addition to his classical knowledge, he was
a poet, a musician, a sculptor, an artist, an actor, a
brilliant conversationalist, a good horseman, and an
excellent fencer. Surely the possessor of such
varied accomplishments deserved a better fate than
that which befell him in the very prime of his life!
He was stabbed by a band of masked desperadoes led
by his own pupil, Vincenzo Gonzaga, the son of the
Duke of Mantua. A genius of a totally different stamp
was George Robert Fitzgerald, better known, owing
to his duelling proclivities, as <b>Fighting Fitzgerald</b>.
This individual was one of the most infamous
characters of the last century. No enemy ever
escaped him with life; being a sure shot and an
expert swordsman, his intense love of gambling and
duelling, united to a haughty and overbearing disposition,
habitually prompted him to shed the blood
of his fellow-men without the least compunction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>A celebrated leader of fashion during the early
part of this century was Robert Coates, popularly
styled <b>Romeo Coates</b> in consequence of his fondness
for playing the part of Romeo at amateur
theatricals. Among other past notabilities of fashion
we may mention <b>Beau Fielding</b>, <b>Beau Brummell</b>,
and <b>Beau Nash</b>, severally so styled from the
foppishness of their attire. The last-named (born
1674, died 1761) was a notorious diner-out, and for
some time Master of the Ceremonies at the fashionable
Assembly Rooms at Bath, where he provided a
series of entertainments the like of which had never
been known. On this account he was surnamed
<b>King of Bath</b>. Alas! though literally the “monarch
of all he surveyed” during the brief period of his
popularity, when at length Death claimed him for
his own he was as poor as the meanest of King
George’s subjects.</p>

<p>But Richard “Beau” Nash was not the only British
subject who has rejoiced in the erstwhile title of King.
As examples: Richard Oastler, of Bradford (born
1789, died 1861), merited the style of <b>The Factory
King</b>, in recognition of his success in promoting the
“Ten Hours’ Bill”; George Hudson, of Yorkshire
(born 1800, died 1871), chairman of the Midland
Railway Company, was denominated <b>The Railway
King</b>, because in one day he cleared the large sum
of £100,000 by fortunate railway speculations; John
Law, the projector of the Mississippi Scheme (born
1671, died 1729), bore the name of <b>The Paper
King</b>, than which, by the way, nothing could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
been more appropriate. The huge fortunes anticipated
by the subscribers to this wholesale fraud
appeared promising enough upon paper, or, to put it
more precisely, in the prospectus; but hard cash
there was none, saving such as passed into the pockets
of the wily promoter. In our own decade we have
<b>The Nitrate King</b>, the sobriquet of Colonel J. T.
North, of Eltham, consequent upon his successful
speculations in the commodity with which his name
has become associated.</p>

<p>John Kyrle, of Ross, Herefordshire (born 1637,
died 1754), well known for his artistic tastes and acts
of benevolence, was styled by Pope <b>The Man of
Ross</b>, because he was constantly effecting improvements
for the public good in the neighbourhood of
his estate. Another local philanthropist was Dr.
William Gordon, of Hull (born 1801, died 1849),
whose surname, <b>The People’s Friend</b>, so well
merited during life, literally followed him to the
grave, where it appears chiselled on his tombstone.
Perhaps the greatest benefactor of the human race
with whom we have become practically acquainted
in modern times, was Father Mathew (born 1790,
died 1856), universally styled <b>The Apostle of
Temperance</b>, beside whom, judging from results,
all our latter-day temperance advocates sink into
insignificance. He was also made the recipient of
the sobriquet <b>The Sinner’s Friend</b>, on account of
the special interest he took in the fallen and the
outcast; even the most degraded always met with a
welcome at his hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Musical Small-coal Man</b> was the popular
designation of Thomas Britton (born 1650, died
1714), a vendor of small coals, which he carried in a
sack over his shoulder and cried in the streets, who
on Thursday evenings gave a series of high-class
instrumental concerts in the room over his shed in
Clerkenwell, assisted by the best talent he could
procure, that attracted all fashionable London. This
gifted person was actually frightened to death by the
freak of a ventriloquist. Thomas Rawlinson, the
bibliopolist (born 1681, died 1725), was appropriately
enough styled <b>Tom Folio</b>. <b>The Infant
Roscius</b> (born 1791, died 1874) was William Henry
Betty, a histrionic prodigy named after the greatest
actor of antiquity. His <i>début</i> took place at Belfast,
August 19, 1803; and three months later he appeared
at Covent Garden (then under the management of
the elder Macready) for twelve nights at a salary of
fifty guineas a night and a clear benefit. During
this brief season the public excitement was so great
that the military had to be called out every night to
preserve order. His last appearance as a boy-actor
occurred at Bath in the year 1808.</p>

<p>William Gerard Hamilton, the Irish Chancellor
of the Exchequer (born 1729, died 1756), has been
handed down to posterity under the name of
<b>Single-speech Hamilton</b>, because he delivered but
one speech in the House, and that was such a marvellous
outburst of rhetoric that it electrified all who
heard it. This memorable incident took place
November 13, 1755. Henry Dundas, afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Lord Melville (born 1740, died 1811), merited the
sobriquet of <b>Starvation Dundas</b> in consequence of
his repeated use of the word “starvation” in the
course of a debate on American affairs in the year
1775. Sir Robert Peel (born 1750, died 1830),
during the time he was Chief Secretary for Ireland
(1812 to 1816), was popularly denominated <b>Orange
Peel</b>, on account of his strong anti-Catholic spirit
[<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_111"><span class="smcap">Orangemen</span></a>]. William Pitt, Earl of Chatham
(born 1708, died 1778), was styled <b>The Heaven-sent
Minister</b> because the most splendid triumphs
of British arms were achieved during his administration.
John Russell, afterwards created Earl Russell
(born 1792, died 1878), received the nickname of
<b>Finality John</b> from the fact of his maintaining that
the Reform Bill of 1832 was a <i>finality</i>. The late
Earl of Beaconsfield (born 1804, died 1881) owed
his popular name of <b>Dizzy</b> to his own habit of
setting forth his early novels during the lifetime of
his father under the authorship of “D’Israeli the
Younger.” In course of time this became shortened
into “Dizzy,” and it clung to him ever afterwards.</p>

<p>Mr. W. E. Gladstone (born 1809) first received
the nickname of <b>The Grand Old Man</b> on the
occasion of the unseating in the House of Commons
of Mr. Charles Bradlaugh (June 1880), through his
refusal to take the oath after his election as member
for Northampton. At this time Mr. Bradlaugh
found a strong champion in Mr. Labouchere; and
the nickname arose out of the latter’s conversation
in the tea-room of the House “I told some friends,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
said Mr. Labouchere, referring to the incident of
Mr. Bradlaugh’s expulsion, “that before I left Mr.
Gladstone came to me, and that <i>grand old man</i>,
with tears in his eyes, took me by the hands and
said, ‘Mr. Labouchere, bring me Mr. Bradlaugh
back again.’”</p>

<p>Mr. William Henry Smith, M.P., the present
First Lord of the Treasury (born 1825), is popularly
known by the name of <b>Bookstall Smith</b> because
he originated the idea of railway bookstalls, and
founded the now widely-popular firm of “W. H.
Smith and Sons.”</p>

<p>Sir Christopher Hatton (born 1540, died 1591)
was styled <b>The Dancing Chancellor</b> because he
first attracted the notice of Queen Elizabeth by his
graceful dancing at one of the Court masques. In
recognition of this accomplishment he was created a
Knight of the Garter and subsequently made Chancellor
of England. <b>Praise-God Barebones</b>, or,
rather, Barebon, who died in 1680, was a leather-seller
and the leader of the celebrated “Barebones Parliament.”
It was a common custom among the Puritans
to nickname people in accordance with their habits
and peculiarities; consequently this individual must
have been addicted to praising God in the hearing
of his neighbours. William Huntingdon, the preacher
and theologian (born 1744, died 1813), called himself
<b>Sinner-saved Huntingdon</b> for reasons doubtless
best known to himself. <b>Orator Henley</b>, otherwise
John Henley (born 1692, died 1756), was an English
divine who in 1726 delivered a course of lectures on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
theological subjects on Sundays, and on secular
subjects on Wednesdays, in a kind of “oratory” or
chapel in Newport Market, which attracted large
congregations.</p>

<p><b>Memory Woodfall</b> was the sobriquet of William
Woodfall (born 1745, died 1803), brother to the
reputed author of the famous “Letters of Junius.”
This person’s memory was so perfect that he was
able, after listening to a Parliamentary debate, to
report it the next morning word for word without the
assistance of any notes whatever. Of another kind
was the memory possessed by John Thompson, the
son of a greengrocer in the parish of St. Giles,
popularly known as <b>Memory-corner Thompson</b>
(born 1757, died 1843) on account of his astounding
local knowledge. Within twenty-four hours, and at
two sittings, he drew entirely from memory a correct
plan of the parish of St. James’s. This plan contained
all the squares, streets, lanes, courts, passages,
markets, churches, chapels, houses, stables, and
angles of houses, in addition to a number of minor
objects, such as walls, trees, &amp;c., and including an
exact plan of Carlton House and St. James’s Palace.
He also, on another occasion, made a correct plan of
St. Andrew’s parish, and offered to do the same with
the parishes of St. Giles, St. Paul’s, Covent Garden,
and St. Clement-Danes. If a particular house in
any given street were named, he would tell at once
what trade was carried on in it, the appearance
and position of the shop, and its contents. In
going through a large hotel completely furnished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
he was able to retain a recollection of everything he
saw, and afterwards make an inventory of the whole.
But, perhaps more wonderful than all, he could,
after having read a newspaper overnight, repeat any
desired portion of its contents <i>verbatim</i> the next
morning. Nowadays such a one would be exhibited
at the Royal Aquarium as a natural curiosity.</p>

<p>Another well-known London character was <b>Dirty
Dick</b>, otherwise Nathaniel Bentley, the miser, who
never washed himself. This extraordinary individual
died in the odour of dirt in the year 1809, leaving an
ample fortune to console his heirs for his loss (?).
The house which he inhabited in Bishopsgate Street
Without has now been converted into a modern wine
and spirit establishment, under the style of <span class="smcap">The
D.D. Cellars</span>. Laurence Brown, the English landscape
gardener (born 1715, died 1783) was nicknamed
<b>Capability Brown</b> owing to his habitual use of
the word <i>capability</i>. At the present day the Duke
of Cambridge (born 1819) is usually denominated
<b>George Ranger</b> in allusion to his appointment as
Ranger of the Royal Parks. Ernest Benzon, author
of “How I Lost £250,000 in Two Years,” rejoiced
in the title of <b>The Jubilee Plunger</b> because he
entered upon his gambling career in 1887, the Jubilee
year of Queen Victoria [<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_237"><span class="smcap">Plunger</span></a>].</p>

<p>A few of the more celebrated painters may now
detain us. Peter Aartsen, the Flemish painter (born
1507, died 1573), bore the name of <b>Long Peter</b> on
account of his extraordinary height; while Gaspar
Smitz, the Dutch portrait painter (died 1689), was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
styled <b>Magdalen Smith</b> because his pictures comprised
mostly “Magdalens.” The real name of the
French landscape painter, <b>Claude Lorraine</b> (born
1600, died 1682), was Claude Gelée <i>of</i> Lorraine;
that of Paolo Veronese, or <b>Paul Veronese</b> (born
1528, died 1588), was Paolo Cagliari, his birth having
taken place in Verona; and that of Jacopa da
Bassano, called <b>Il Bassano</b> (born 1510, died 1592),
was Jacopa da Ponte, whose native place was
Bassano, in the Venetian State. Pietro Vanucci
(born 1446, died 1524), though recognizing Città
della Pieve as his birthplace, was all his life established
in the neighbouring city of Perugia, where he
claimed the right of citizenship; hence the origin of
his more common name <b>Il Perugino</b>. Francesco
Rossi (born 1510, died 1563), adopted the name of
<b>Del Salviati</b>, in honour of his patron, Cardinal
Salviati, who was his own age exactly, and, strangely
enough, died in the same year as himself. Giuseppe
Ribera (born 1588, died 1656), was popularly surnamed
<b>Lo Spagnoletto</b> (“the Little Spaniard”), from
the shortness of his stature and his birth at Xativa,
in Spain; while Tommaso Guidi (born 1402, died
1428), merited his better-known name of <b>Masaccio</b>,
owing to the slovenliness of his habits, the direct consequence
of an all-absorbing attention to his studies.
Jacopo Robusti (born 1512, died 1594) received his
now far more popular name of <b>Tintoretto</b> because
his father followed the occupation of a <i>tintore</i>, or dyer.
During his lifetime, this celebrated Italian painter
merited the additional sobriquet of <b>Il Furioso</b> owing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
to the rapidity with which he produced his work.
Quintin Matsys (born 1466, died 1530), whose
masterpiece, “The Taking Down from the Cross,”
has achieved a world-wide reputation, is equally
known to fame by the name of <b>The Smith of Antwerp</b>,
owing to the circumstance of having followed
for a time, and with great distinction, his father’s
occupation of a blacksmith. His attachment to the
pretty daughter of a painter, however, caused him
eventually to forsake the anvil for the palette.
Nearer home the historical portrait painter, David
Allan (born 1744, died 1796) was surnamed <b>The
Scottish Hogarth</b> in compliment to his excellence;
and William Huggins (born 1821, died 1884), <b>The
Liverpool Landseer</b>, in favourable comparison with
the celebrated English animal painter of that name.</p>

<p>Simon Bolivar, the South American hero (born
1783, died 1830), justly merited the dignified title of
<b>The Liberator</b>; while General John Charles Fremont
(born 1813, died 1890) won the surname of
<b>The Pathfinder</b> after his fourth successful exploring
expedition across the Rocky Mountains in 1842.
Lastly, Jonathan Hastings, a farmer of Cambridge,
Massachusetts, U.S., was styled <b>Yankee Jonathan</b>
in consequence of his addiction to the word <i>Yankee</i>
in the place of “excellent.” Thus he would say,
“A Yankee good horse,” “A Yankee good cider,”
&amp;c. This individual, however, must not be confounded
with “Brother Jonathan,” the nickname of
the typical American, to which reference is made
in another portion of this work.</p>

<h2 id="THE_INNS_OF_COURT"><i>THE INNS OF COURT.</i></h2>

<p>As by reference to our article on <a href="#TAVERN_SIGNS"><span class="smcap">Tavern Signs</span></a>
it will be seen how the word <i>Inn</i> originally
denoted a private mansion, it will suffice to
state here that the various colleges of the law
students in London are styled <b>Inns</b> because the
chief of them were at one time the residences of the
nobility whose family names they still bear. Thus,
<b>Lincoln’s Inn</b> was the town mansion of the Earls
of Lincoln, <b>Gray’s Inn</b>, of the Earls Gray, <b>Furnival’s
Inn</b>, of the Lords Furnival, and <b>Clifford’s
Inn</b>, of the Lords Clifford. The two first-named,
together with the Inner and Middle Temple, are the
principal <b>Inns of Court</b>, so called because the
earliest seminaries for the study of the law were
established in one of the courts of the King’s palace.
The Inns of lesser import are:&mdash;<b>Serjeants’ Inn</b>,
originally the establishment of the “Frères Serjens,”
or Serving Brothers to the Knights Templars who
occupied <b>The Temple</b> close by; <b>Barnard’s Inn</b>&mdash;sold
and abolished in 1881&mdash;named after its ancient
owner; <b>Staple Inn</b>, formerly the Hall of the
Merchants of the Staple, <i>i.e.</i>, wool; <b>Clement’s Inn</b>
and <b>Dane’s Inn</b>, so designated from their proximity
to the Church of St. Clement-Danes; and <b>New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Inn</b>, the latest of all the Inns erected in the early
part of the last century. <b>Thavie’s Inn</b> no longer
exists, but the title still adheres to a range of
modern buildings erected upon its site. No person
of the name of Thavie ever owned or occupied the
original premises; nevertheless, when the Inn was
established as an appendage to Lincoln’s Inn, about
the middle of the fourteenth century, the Benchers
unanimously agreed to perpetuate the memory of
one John Thavie, an armourer who, dying in the
year 1348, bequeathed a number of houses in
Holborn, representing considerable rentals, to the
neighbouring church of St. Andrew, and named it
“Thavie’s Inn” accordingly.</p>

<p>The senior members of the Inns of Court are
styled <b>Benchers</b> by reason of the benches on which
they formerly sat.</p>

<h2 id="RACES"><i>RACES.</i></h2>

<p><b>Goodwood Races</b> are held once a year in
Goodwood Park, the property of the Duke
of Richmond; <b>Ascot Races</b>, on Ascot
Heath, in Berkshire, and <b>Epsom Races</b>, on Epsom
Downs, near London. The <b>Derby Stakes</b>, at
Epsom, were named after Edward Smith Stanley,
twelfth Earl of Derby, who founded them in 1780, the
year after he established the <b>Oaks Stakes</b>; so called
from an inn known as “Lamberts’ Oaks,” originally
erected by the Hunters’ Club and rented by a
family named Lambert upon land which subsequently
passed into the possession of the Derby family. The
<b>St. Leger Stakes</b>, otherwise the <b>Doncaster St.
Leger</b>, annually run for at Doncaster, were established
by Colonel Anthony St. Leger in 1776.</p>

<p>A <b>Hurdle Race</b> is one in which hurdles are
placed at different points along the course. A
<b>Steeplechase</b> is confined to thoroughbred hunters
whose riders are bound to make for the winning-post
straight across the country, guided by flags displayed
on the highest points along the line, and to clear
whatever ditches, fences, walls, or other obstacles
that may lie in their course. The term originated
from the incident of an unsuccessful hunting-party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
agreeing to race to the village church, of which the
steeple was just in sight; and he who touched the
building first with his whip was to be declared the
winner. A <b>Scratched Horse</b> is one whose name
has been struck out of the final list of runners in a
particular race. A <b>Sweepstake</b> is a term used to
denote the whole amount staked by different persons
upon one race, and cleared literally “at one sweep”
by the fortunate individual who has backed the
winner.</p>

<h2 id="LONDON_CHURCHES_AND"><i>LONDON CHURCHES AND
BUILDINGS.</i></h2>

<p>In all probability the name of <b>Westminster
Abbey</b> would never have come into existence
had it not been necessary to distinguish the
Abbey Church lying to the west of St. Paul’s (founded
by Ethelbert in 610) from another Abbey Church
that stood upon the rising ground now known as
Tower Hill. Consequently, the one was described
as the <i>West Minster</i>, the other the <i>East Minster</i>; and
when, in course of time, the latter was swept away,
the western edifice not only retained the description
of “The West Minster,” but gave its name also to
the district around. The earliest mention of West
Minster occurs in a Saxon charter dated 785.</p>

<p>The <b>Temple</b> comprised the chief seat in this
country of the Knights Templars after their return
from the Holy Land. The <b>Savoy Chapel</b> is a
modern edifice built by the Queen to replace the
original, destroyed by fire July, 7, 1864, which
formed the only remaining portion of the old <b>Savoy
Palace</b> erected by Peter of Savoy, the uncle of
Eleanor, queen of Henry III., in 1249, on land
granted to him by that monarch.</p>

<p>The Church of <b>St. Clement-Danes</b> owes its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
compound title to the fact of being dedicated to St.
Clement, and of Harold, a Danish king, together
with several other Danes lying buried within its
walls. The Church of <b>St. Mary-le-Bow</b>, Cheapside,
otherwise <b>Bow Church</b>, was so denominated
because it was the first church ever built upon bows
or arches. The Church of <b>St. Mary Woolnoth</b>,
at the corner of Lombard Street and King William
Street, is supposed to be a corruption of St. Mary
Woolnough, so called by way of distinction from a
neighbouring church of “St. Mary of the Wool,”
that stood beside the beam or wool-staple. The
Church of <b>St. Mary-Axe</b>, now vanished, received
this name from its situation opposite to a shop
that displayed an axe for its sign. The Church of
<b>St. Catherine Cree</b>, Leadenhall Street, is properly
St. Catherine and Trinity, being originally a chapel
dedicated to St. Catherine in the churchyard of the
priory church of Holy Trinity, afterwards merged into
the parishes of Christ Church, St. Mary Magdalen,
and St. Michael. The Church of <b>St. Catherine
Coleman</b>, Fenchurch Street, dedicated to St.
Catherine, is so designated because it was built in
a large garden belonging to a person named Coleman.
The Church of <b>St. Margaret Pattens</b>,
Rood Lane, did not receive its denomination
from the patten-makers who congregated in this
neighbourhood, but because its roof was formerly
decorated with gilt spots or <i>patines</i>; a patine being
the name of a small circular dish of gold used to
cover the chalice at the altar. Lovers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>

<p>The original <b>Church of St. Sepulchre</b>, founded
during the time of the Crusades, was so denominated
in honour of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem. The
name of <b>St. Bride’s Church</b>, Fleet Street, is a contraction
of St. Bridget’s Church. The Church of <b>St.
Andrew Undershaft</b>, Leadenhall Street, dedicated
to St. Andrew, was originally so called because its
steeple was of lesser altitude than the tall shaft
or maypole which stood opposite the south door.
Hence, the church was literally “under the shaft.”
The parish of St. Mary-Axe is now united to that
of St. Andrew Undershaft. The Church of <b>St.
Helen’s</b>, Bishopsgate, was built and dedicated to
St. Helena, the mother of Constantine, in 1180, just
thirty years before William Fitzwilliam, a rich goldsmith,
founded in connection therewith a priory of
Benedictine nuns, dedicated to the Holy Cross and
St. Helena. The neighbouring Church of <b>St.
Ethelburga</b> was so named in honour of the
daughter of King Ethelbert. The Church of <b>Allhallowes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Barking</b>, at the bottom of Mark Lane,
derived the second portion of its title from the fact
that it belonged to the ancient abbey and convent
at Barking, in Essex. <b>St. Olave’s Church</b>, Tooley
Street, is properly described as <b>St. Olaf’s Church</b>,
being dedicated to Olaf, a Norwegian prince of great
renown, who came over to this country at the
invitation of the King Ethelred, and rendered good
service in expelling the Danes.</p>

<p>The central portion of the Tower of London, supposed
to have been built by Julius Cæsar, is known
as the <b>White Tower</b> on account of the white
stone employed in its construction. In the <b>Bloody
Tower</b> the Infant Princes were murdered by order
of their uncle, Richard III.; and in the <b>Beauchamp
Tower</b>, Thomas de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick,
was imprisoned by Richard II. for leading the conspiracy
of the Barons for the removal of Sir Simon
de Burley, the young King’s favourite. At the accession
of Henry IV. the Earl obtained his liberty.
<b>Traitors’ Gate</b> denotes the river gate by which all
State prisoners convicted of high treason were
admitted into the Tower. <b>Newgate Prison</b> derived
its name from its original situation next to the
newest of the five principal gates of the City. The
prison is first mentioned in history under date 1207.
The present gloomy edifice was built in 1782. The
open space between the prison and the Old Bailey
was formerly known as the <b>Press Yard</b>, because
here it was that prisoners who refused to plead upon
trial were barbarously pressed to death. The <b>Old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Bailey</b> Sessions House received its name from the
street in which it stands [<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_260"><span class="smcap">Old Bailey</span></a> in the
article “<a href="#LONDON_STREETS_AND_SQUARES"><span class="smcap">London Streets and Squares</span></a>.”] The
old <b>Marshalsea Prison</b>, Southwark, abolished and
pulled down in 1842, was so called because it contained
the Court of the Knight-Marshal, whose duty it
was to settle disputes occurring between the members
of the Royal Household. This office now belongs to
the Steward of the Royal Household. <b>Bridewell</b> was
a corruption of “St. Bridget’s Well,” discovered in
the grounds attached to an ancient hospital, afterwards
converted into a house of correction for
females. An iron pump let into the wall of the
churchyard at the upper end of Bride Lane indicates
the exact spot where the dames of old were wont to
drink the virtuous waters. The <b>Fleet Prison</b> took
its name from the river, now a common sewer, near
which it stood. The northern boundary of the prison
is now defined by <b>Fleet Lane</b>, which runs from
Farringdon Street to the Old Bailey.</p>

<p><b>St. John’s Gate</b>, Clerkenwell, is the sole remaining
portion of the priory of St. John of Jerusalem,
the seat in this country of the Knights Hospitallers,
instituted by Godfrey de Boulogne. The Gate now
forms the headquarters of the St. John’s Ambulance
Association. <b>Temple Bar</b> was not one of the City
fortifications, but the ordinary gateway of the Temple.
It was popularly known as <b>The City Golgotha</b>,
owing to the spiked heads of traitors exposed thereon&mdash;<i>Golgotha</i>
being Hebrew for “the place of skulls.”
The Bar was taken down in 1878. <b>London Bridge</b>&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
is to say, the original structure&mdash;was the first
bridge over the Thames. The present structure was
thrown open August 1, 1831. <b>Billingsgate</b> traces its
origin to Belin, one of the early kings of Britain, who
built a gate on the site of the present market and gave
it his name. <b>St. Katherine’s Docks</b> received their
title from an ancient hospital dedicated to St.
Katherine, swept away by their construction in the
year 1828. <b>The Mint</b> is so called in accordance
with the Anglo-Saxon <i>mynet</i>, coin [<i>see</i> <a href="#MONEY"><span class="smcap">Money</span></a>].
The <b>Trinity House</b>, the seat of the Trinity Corporation,
which controls the pilotage of the Thames
and the various lighthouses, buoys, harbour-dues,
&amp;c., around our coast, owed its foundation to Sir
Thomas Spert, Comptroller of the Navy of Henry
VIII., and commander of the <i>Harry Grace de Dieu</i>,
originally situated at Deptford; it was incorporated
in 1529 under the style of “The Master-Wardens
and Assistants of the Guild, or Fraternity, or
Brotherhood, of the most glorious and undivisible
Trinity, and St. Clement, in the parish of Deptford,
Stroud, in the County of Kent.” The present
edifice was built in 1795. <b>Crosby Hall</b>, Bishopsgate,
at one time a palace, but now converted into
a restaurant, was built by Sir John Crosby about
the middle of the fifteenth century. The <b>Congregational
Memorial Hall</b>, Farringdon Road,
which occupies part of the site of the old Fleet
Prison, was built in 1872 to memorate the ejection
of more than two thousand Church of England
ministers from their charges, August 24, 1662,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
consequent upon their refusal to subscribe to the
“Act of Uniformity” [<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_74"><span class="smcap">Nonconformists</span></a>].
The <b>Guildhall</b> is the hall of the City guilds;
the word <span class="smcap">Guild</span> being derived from the Anglo-Saxon
<i>gildan</i>, to pay, alluding to the fee paid for
membership. <b>Doctors’ Commons</b>, originally established
as a college for the Professors of Canon
and Civil Law, received its name from the rule
which required the Doctors to dine at a common
table. That sombre-looking structure, the <b>College
of Arms</b>, otherwise <b>Heralds’ College</b>, is the office
where the records of the genealogical descent of all
our noble families are preserved, and where searches
for coats-of-arms may be instituted. The Corporation
of the College dates back to the year
1484. The General Post Office is officially denominated
<b>St. Martin’s-le-Grand</b> because it occupies
the site of a collegiate church and sanctuary
of that name founded by Within, King of Kent in
750, and chartered by William the Conqueror in
1068.</p>

<p>The <b>Charterhouse</b>, originally a monastery of the
Carthusians, is a corruption of <i>La Chartreuse</i>, the
name of the district in France where this religious
Order first came into existence. <b>Christ’s Hospital</b>,
also known as the <b>Blue Coat School</b>, from the
colour of the coats worn by the boys, retains the
ancient designation of a church and school belonging
to the Grey Friars. It is only in modern times, by
the way, that the term <b>Hospital</b> has come to be exclusively
applied in this country to a refuge for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
sick. Properly understood, a hospital denotes a
house intended for the reception and accommodation
of travellers; the source of the word being the Latin
<i>hospitalis</i>, pertaining to a guest, based upon <i>hospes</i>, a
stranger, a guest, and from which we derive the
word <span class="smcap">Hospitality</span>. The great Bernardine monastery
on the summit of the Alps, devoted to the good
work of rescuing snow-bound travellers, is appropriately
denominated a <b>Hospice</b>, which answers to
our Hospital. <b>St. Bartholomew’s Hospital</b> was
founded by Rahare, a monk attached to the neighbouring
Priory of St. Bartholomew in 1123; whereas
<b>Guy’s Hospital</b> arose out of the bequest of
£238,292, by the will of Thomas Guy, a benevolent
bookseller of Lombard Street, who died in 1722.
<b>Bedlam</b> is a contraction of <b>Bethlehem Hospital</b>, a
lazar-house named after the Hospital of St. Mary at
Bethlehem, and converted into a lunatic asylum in
1815. This was the common designation in ancient
times for a refuge for the poor, the word <b>Bethlehem</b>
expressing the Hebrew for “a house of bread”; but
in more modern times the synonym <b>Lazar-house</b>
was substituted in allusion to Lazarus, who picked
up the crumbs under the table of Dives. A refuge
for fallen women has always borne the name of a
<b>Magdalen Hospital</b> in honour of Mary Magdalen.</p>

<p><b>St. James’s Palace</b> marks the site of an ancient
leper hospital dedicated to St. James the Less,
Bishop of Jerusalem. The present edifice was built
by Henry VIII. in 1530. <b>Buckingham Palace</b>
displaced old Buckingham House, the town mansion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
of John Sheffield, Duke of Buckingham, in the year
1825. The total cost to the nation of this “desirable
residence” was £1,000,000. <b>Marlborough House</b>
was originally the town residence of John, Duke of
Marlborough, erected by Sir Christopher Wren in
1709. <b>Somerset House</b> reverted to the Crown by
the attainder of its owner, Edward Seymour, Duke
of Somerset, the Lord Protector of Edward VI.,
executed January 22, 1552. <b>Whitehall</b> received
its name from the fresh appearance of its exterior as
contrasted with the ancient buildings on the opposite
side of the way. The present fabric, viz., <b>The
Banquetting Hall</b>, is merely a vestige of the
palace originally set apart by Cardinal Wolsey for
the London See of York: whence he gave it the name
of “York House.” The <b>Horse Guards</b> is so called
because a troop of Horse Guards are regularly
quartered here. <b>Dover House</b> was named after its
owner, the Hon. George Agar Ellis, afterwards
created Lord Dover; and <b>York House</b>, after the
Duke of York and Albany who bought it in 1789.
<b>Devonshire House</b>, Piccadilly, is the town residence
of the Duke of Devonshire. <b>Apsley House</b>, Hyde
Park Corner, well known as the residence of the Duke
of Wellington, received its name from Henry Apsley,
Lord Chancellor, afterwards created Lord Bathurst,
who built it in 1784. <b>Chandos House</b>, Cavendish
Square, was the residence of James Brydges, “the
Princely Duke of Chandos.” The <b>Albany</b>, Piccadilly,
perpetuates the memory of the Duke of York
and Albany, who acquired it from Lord Melbourne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
in exchange for his older residence, York House, in
Whitehall. <b>Burlington House</b>, the home of the
Royal Academy of Arts and quite a number of
learned societies, was built by Sir John Denham, the
poet and judge, in 1718, and refronted by the
celebrated amateur architect, Richard Boyle, Earl of
Burlington and Cork, in 1731. This palatial edifice
was purchased by the State in 1854. The <b>Soane
Museum</b>, Lincoln’s Inn Fields, was the private
collection of Sir John Soane, the architect and
antiquary, who died in 1837. <b>The Rolls Chapel</b>,
Chancery Lane, bears this name because it was
annexed by patent to the office of the Master of the
Rolls of Chancery after the banishment of the Jews
from England in the year 1290. The history of
the chapel dates from 1283, when Henry III.
founded it for the reception of the Jewish rabbis
converted to Christianity.</p>

<p>The <b>Painted Hall</b>, Greenwich Hospital, owes its
name to its magnificently decorated ceiling. <b>Vanburgh
Castle</b>, Blackheath, was built in the castellated
style by Sir John Vanburgh, in 1717. <b>Rye
House</b>, famous for being the scene of the conspiracy
to assassinate Charles II., which was discovered
June 12, 1683, is so called from the rye on which
it stands; <span class="smcap">Rye</span> being an Old English term for a
common, derived from <i>ree</i>, a watercourse: hence
<span class="smcap">Peckham Rye</span>.</p>

<p><b>Bruce Castle</b>, Tottenham, has a history all its
own. The present structure dates back to the latter
part of the seventeenth century; but the original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
building was erected by Earl Waltheof, whose
marriage with Judith, the niece of William the
Conqueror, brought him portions of the earldoms
of Northumberland and Huntingdon. Their only
daughter, Maud, on becoming the wife of David I.,
King of Scotland, placed him in possession of the
Huntingdon estates, and, as appended to that
property, the manor of Tottenham, in Middlesex.
Ultimately these possessions descended to Robert
Bruce, the brother of William III., King of Scotland.
The contention between Robert Bruce and
John Baliol for the Scottish throne being decided
in favour of the latter, the former retired to England,
and settling on his grandfather’s estate
at Tottenham, repaired the castle to which he
gave the name of “The Castle Bruce.” <b>Lincoln
House</b>, Enfield, was the residence of the second and
third Earls of Lincoln in the seventeenth century.
<b>Sandford House</b>, Stoke Newington, is interesting
as having been the residence of Thomas Day, the
author of “Sandford and Merton” (born 1748, died
1789). <b>Cromwell House</b>, Highgate, now a Convalescent
Hospital for sick children, was occupied
for some time by Oliver Cromwell, who built <b>Ireton
House</b>, close by, for Henry Ireton, his son-in-law,
in 1630; while <b>Lauderdale House</b>, lately a Convalescent
Home in connection with St. Bartholomew’s
Hospital, was the residence of the Earls
of Lauderdale during the seventeenth century.
<span class="smcap">Waterlow Park</span>, in this neighbourhood&mdash;in fact,
comprising among other valuable property the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
grounds appertaining to Lauderdale House&mdash;was
generously presented to the London public by Sir
Sydney Waterlow, in November, 1890. The
<b>Clock House</b>, Hampstead, originally displayed a
clock in place of the present sun-dial. <b>Rosslyn
House</b>, Hampstead, which gives the name to
<span class="smcap">Rosslyn Hill Park</span>, was erected by Alexander
Wedderburn, first Earl of Rosslyn and Lord
Chancellor of England, in 1795. <b>Erskine House</b>,
Hampstead, adjoining “The Spaniards,” was the
residence of Lord Erskine, Lord Chancellor of
England, who died here in 1823.</p>

<p><b>Strawberry Hill</b>, the celebrated palace of curiosities
built by Horace Walpole in 1750, received its
name from the rising ground upon which it stood.
The building was sold by public auction, and purchased
by Baron H. de Stein, in July, 1883.
<b>Orleans House</b>, Twickenham, now a club, was
named after Louis Philippe of France, who resided
in it when he was simply Duc d’Orleans. <b>Essex
House</b>, Putney, was one of the many residences of
Robert Devereaux, Earl of Essex, the favourite of
Queen Elizabeth. <b>Bristol House</b>, Putney, was,
until recently, the property of the Bristol family.
<b>Craven Cottage</b>, Fulham, was built by the Countess
of Craven, afterwards created Margravine of Anspach.
<b>Munster House</b>, Fulham, derived its title from its
one-time resident, Melesina Schulenberg, created
Duchess of Munster in 1716. <b>Peterborough
House</b>, Parson’s Green, was formerly the mansion
of the Mordaunts, Earls of Peterborough. <b>Sussex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
House</b>, Hammersmith, was the favourite residence
of the late Duke of Sussex. <b>Holland House</b>,
Kensington, owes its name to Henry Rich, Earl of
Holland, by whose father-in-law, Sir William Cope,
it was built in 1607. Here Charles James Fox, the
eminent orator and statesman (born 1749, died 1806),
passed many of his earlier years; here also Joseph
Addison, the poet and essayist, died in the year 1719.</p>

<p>The <b>Albert Hall</b>, <b>Albert Memorial</b>, <b>Albert
Bridge</b>, and <b>Albert Palace</b>, each preserve the
memory of the Prince Consort, whose death took
place in 1861. The <b>Crystal Palace</b>, opened by the
Queen, June 10, 1854, derived its title from its glass
structure, which, when the sun shines upon it,
glistens like crystal. The <b>Alexandra Palace</b> was
named after the Princess of Wales, who was to have
opened the original building, May 24, 1873; but, for
some unexplained reason, she did not perform that
ceremony. <b>Olympia</b>, opened December, 1886, is
an appropriate designation for a huge edifice eminently
adapted for every variety of popular amusement.
The allusion is to Olympia, in Greece, where
the celebrated “Olympian Games” were anciently
held every fourth year. The <b>Polytechnic Institution</b>,
Regent Street (now the Y. M. C. A.), was
designated in strict conformity with its set purpose
as an educational establishment, viz., from the two
Greek words <i>polus</i>, many, and <i>techne</i>, an art. <b>St.
George’s Hall</b> was originally, when opened in
1867, St. George’s Opera House, so styled because
situated in the fashionable parish of St. George’s,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Hanover Square. The <b>Egyptian Hall</b>, built in
1812, is a particularly well-chosen title; at
least, it appears so at the present day, since the
regular performances of those modern magicians,
Messrs. Maskelyne and Cooke, have long ago
become one of the institutions, if not actually one
of the sights, of the Metropolis. <b>St. James’s
Hall</b> was named after the parish church just
opposite. <b>Willis’s Rooms</b>, so called after their late
proprietor, were originally opened by a Scotsman
named Almack, under the style of <b>Almack’s Assembly
Rooms</b>, February 12, 1765. <b>Exeter Hall</b>
was built in the year 1830 in the grounds of Exeter
House, which also gave the name to <b>Exeter
’Change</b>, erected in 1680 and pulled down in 1829
[<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_275"><span class="smcap">Exeter Street</span></a>]. The world-famous waxworks
exhibition known as <b>Madame Tussaud’s</b> retains
the name of its foundress (born 1760, died 1850) who
first set up her figures at the old Lyceum Theatre
in 1802, and after undergoing a variety of misfortunes
settled down permanently in Baker Street
in the year 1833.</p>

<p><b>Scotland Yard</b>, the headquarters of the Metropolitan
Police, received its name from an ancient
palace erected on this spot for the accommodation
of the Scottish kings in the days when they were
annually required to pay homage to the Crown of
England at Westminster. The first monarch so accommodated
was Kenneth II. (died 854); the last
was Margaret, Queen of Scots, the sister of Henry
VIII. <b>Lord’s Cricket Ground</b>, familiarly styled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
<b>Lord’s</b>, owes its existence to Thomas Lord, who
established, upon land of his own, first on the site of
Dorset Square in 1780, and subsequently on its
present site, the only cricketing ground where
genteel players could meet to enjoy this game without
fear of rubbing shoulders with the City apprentices.
Previous to his enterprise the formation
of a private Cricket Club had never been thought of.
<b>Tattersall’s</b>, the well-known rendezvous for the sale
of horses, was opened by Richard Tattersall near
Hyde Park Corner in 1766, and removed to Knightsbridge
April 10, 1865.</p>

<p><b>Lloyd’s Rooms</b>, better known as <b>Lloyd’s</b>, derived
this title from Edward Lloyd, a coffee-house
keeper in Abchurch Lane, whose premises became
the regular resort of merchants and others interested
in shipping. The original location of a special office
for the transaction of mercantile business over the
Royal Exchange took place in 1775; but the name
of the genial coffee-house keeper was by common
consent transferred with it. On the destruction by
fire of the first Royal Exchange, in 1838, “Lloyd’s”
was temporarily removed until the completion of
the present building in 1844.</p>

<p>The entrance to the privileged precincts of the
Stock Exchange is called <b>Capel Court</b>, because it
marks the residence of Sir William Capel, Lord
Mayor of London in the year 1504. The term <b>Exchange</b>
owes its origin to the French <i>echanger</i>, to
trade, to barter. The object of the original <b>Royal
Exchange</b>, founded by Sir Thomas Gresham in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
1506 and opened by Queen Elizabeth amid sundry
public rejoicings over the event (which accounts for
the prenomen “Royal”), January 31, 1571, was to
provide a convenient place where the merchants,
bankers, and brokers of the City could meet throughout
the day for the transaction of business. The
<b>Stock Exchange</b> is the great money mart of the
world [<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_256"><span class="smcap">Stock</span></a> in the article “<a href="#MONEY"><span class="smcap">Money</span></a>”].</p>

<p>The <b>Bankers’ Clearing House</b>, in Lombard
Street, is the establishment where all cheques,
drafts, and bills drawn upon the various bankers
are sorted, distributed, and balanced up. The
<b>Railway Clearing House</b>, adjoining Euston
Railway Station, is a similar establishment devoted
to the adjustment of the value represented by the
tickets issued by the different Railway Companies.
In conclusion, the title of <b>Mansion House</b>, though
somewhat suggestive of tautology, may be accepted
as denoting <i>the</i> house of all other houses, since it is
the official residence of the Lord Mayor.</p>

<h2 id="CLASS_NAMES_AND_NICKNAMES"><i>CLASS NAMES AND NICKNAMES.</i></h2>

<p>An unmarried female originally received the
designation of <b>Spinster</b> from her employment
at the distaff or spindle. According to
the practical notions of our Anglo-Saxon forefathers,
a female was not considered fit to enter the married
state until she had made for herself a complete set of
body, bed, and table-linen. Hence the significance of
the term <b>Wife</b>, derived from the Anglo-Saxon <i>wif</i>, by
virtue of the verb <i>wyfan</i>, to weave. The designation
<b>Widow</b> is an Indo-European importation, derived
from the Sanskrit <i>vid-hava</i>, without husband. <b>Grass
Widow</b>, denoting a woman temporarily separated
from her husband, is a corruption of “Grace Widow”&mdash;in
other words, a widow by grace, or courtesy. The
word <b>Chaperon</b> is French, derived from the chapeau,
or cap, worn by the duennas of Spain. <b>Duenna</b>,
signifying a guardian, is Spanish, founded upon the
Latin <i>domina</i>, a mistress. The title of <b>Dowager</b>,
which distinguishes a widow left with a jointure from
the wife of her late husband’s heir, comes from the
French <i>douairière</i>, built upon the verb <i>douaire</i>, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
dower. The name of <b>Blue Stocking</b> arose from
the colour of the stockings worn by the members of
the lady clubs in England during the days of Boswell.
Gentlemen were not excluded from these
assemblies, but the wearing of blue stockings was a
<i>sine quâ non</i> of admittance. The last surviving member
of the original <span class="smcap">Blue Stocking Club</span>, founded by Mrs.
Montague in 1780, died in 1840. The earliest Blue
Stocking assembly came into existence at Venice,
under the title of <i>Della Calza</i> in the year 1400. A
lady’s-maid is familiarly styled an <b>Abigail</b>, in allusion
to the handmaid who introduced herself to
David (1 <i>Samuel</i> xxv. 23). This class-name came
into particular prominence during the early part of the
eighteenth century, in compliment to Abigail Hill, the
maiden name of Mrs. Mashem, the waiting-woman
of Queen Anne. A Parisian shop or work-girl is
known as a <b>Grisette</b> on account of the grey cloth
of which her dress is made. In olden times all
inferior classes in France were expected to be clad
in <i>gris</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, grey. <b>Colleen</b> is the native Irish for
girl; and <b>Colleen Bawn</b> for a blonde girl. How
little the latter expression is understood by actresses
is shown by the way in which some of them essay to
impersonate (?) the heroine of Dion Boucicault’s
well-known drama whilst wearing their own dark
hair or a dark wig. Truly, a little knowledge is a
useful thing!</p>

<p>As nowadays comprehended, a <b>Milliner</b> is one who
retails hats, feathers, bonnets, ribbons, and similar
appurtenances to female costume. The name is really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
a corruption of <i>Milaner</i>, alluding to the city of Milan,
which at one time set the fashion to the north of
Europe in all matters of taste and elegance.
<b>Haberdasher</b> is a modern form of the Old English
word <i>Hapertaser</i>, or a retailer of hapertas cloth, the
width of which was settled by Magna Charta.
<b>Grocer</b> is a contraction and modified spelling of
<b>Engrosser</b>, the denomination of a tradesman who,
in the Middle Ages, claimed a monopoly for the
supply of provisions. A vendor of vegetables is appropriately
called a <b>Greengrocer</b>. An innkeeper
is facetiously styled a <b>Boniface</b> in honour of a
devout and hospitable man whom St. Augustine
caused to be canonized, and who subsequently
became the patron saint of Germany. Shakespeare,
Dante, Bacon, and Lamb never tired of referring to
Boniface. <b>Ostler</b> is a corruption of the French
<i>hostelier</i>, an innkeeper; hence we sometimes speak
of an inn as a <span class="smcap">Hostelry</span>. The term <b>Carpenter</b>,
from the Latin <i>carpentum</i>, a waggon, originally
denoted a mechanic who constructed the wooden
body of a vehicle of any kind, as distinguished from
the <b>Wheelwright</b>; but in process of time the same
term came to be applied to artificers in timber
generally. The provincial name for such a one is
a <b>Joiner</b>, literally a joiner of wooden building
materials. In some districts of England a shoemaker
still bears the name of <b>Cordwainer</b>.
Formerly all shoemakers were styled Cordwainers,
because they were workers in <span class="smcap">Cordwain</span>, a corruption
of <span class="smcap">Cordovan</span>, which was the name of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
particular kind of leather brought from Cordova.
The designation <b>Tailor</b> is an Anglicized form of
the French <i>Tailleur</i>, derived from the verb <i>tailler</i>,
to cut. [For <b>Tallyman</b> <i>see</i> <a href="#Page_256"><span class="smcap">Tally</span></a>, in the article
“<a href="#MONEY"><span class="smcap">Money</span></a>.”] A Pawnbroker is familiarly called
<b>Uncle</b>, in perpetuation of an ancient pun on the
Latin word <i>uncus</i>, a hook. For, whereas in modern
times the spout is employed as a means of communication
between the pawnshop and the store-rooms
overhead, the Roman pawnbrokers used a large
hook; and accordingly, the expression “Gone to
the <i>uncus</i>,” was equivalent to our slang phrase “Up
the spout.” A <b>Barber</b> derives his class-title from
the Latin <i>barba</i>, a beard. Rude and semi-civilized
tribes were anciently called <b>Barbarians</b>, because
they belonged to no order of society. Between the
fourteenth and sixteenth centuries the hairdressers
of this country combined the practice of surgery,
and were accordingly styled <b>Barber-Surgeons</b>.
The surviving “Barber’s Pole” attests this fact.
The separation of the two professions took place
in 1540.</p>

<p>A shepherd or an ideal farmer bears the poetical
description of an <b>Arcadian</b>, in allusion to the
Arcadians, who were a pastoral people. A friendly
adviser is designated a <b>Mentor</b>, in memory of the
wise and faithful counsellor of Telemachus so named.
The word <b>Usher</b> signifies a doorkeeper, agreeably
to the Old French <i>huisher</i>, a door. <b>Bachelor</b> comes
from the Welsh <i>bach</i>, small, young. This name
originally meant one inexperienced in anything.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
The title of <b>Bachelor of Arts</b> denotes a degree
next below that of <b>Master of Arts</b>.</p>

<p><b>Beefeaters</b> is a vulgar perversion of <i>Buffetiers</i>, as
the Yeoman of the Guard were styled during the
reign of Henry VIII., on account of their attendance
upon the King’s <i>Buffet</i>, or side-table. The word
<span class="smcap">Buffet</span> is French, derived from the Spanish <i>búfia</i>, a
wineskin. The civic guardians of law and order are
denominated <b>Police</b> in accordance with the Greek
<i>polis</i>, the city. For many years after the establishment
of the Police through the measures of Sir
Robert Peel (in Ireland, as the national constabulary
in 1814; in London as a regular force in 1829), all
<b>Policemen</b> were nicknamed <b>Bobbies</b> and <b>Peelers</b>,
in allusion to their founder. <b>Bow Street Runners</b>
were the original London detective force; so called
because their headquarters was Bow Street, whence
they were despatched to any part of the country in
quest of the perpetrator of a particular crime. The
predecessors of the Police were a set of decrepit old
watchmen whose regular habit was to fall asleep in
their boxes with their lanthorns beside them. These
were derisively nicknamed <b>Old Charlies</b>; while
their natural enemies, who loved nothing so much as
to turn their boxes upon them, to molest defenceless
females, mutilate males, and in many other ways to
terrorize the peaceable inhabitants of the Metropolis,
styled themselves first of all <b>Scourers</b>, and at a
later date <b>Mohocks</b>, after the North American
Indian tribe of that name. During the years 1859
and 1860 an even more grievous terror haunted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
streets of London in the persons of <b>The Garrotters</b>,
so called from the <i>Garrotte</i>, the instrument with
which condemned malefactors are strangled in Spain.
The punishment of the “cat o’ nine tails” for
“Garrotting,” which came into operation July 13,
1861, gradually put an end to the practice. The
latest terror of the streets which, unhappily, abounds
in American cities, are the <b>Sandbaggers</b>, so called
because they stun their victims with an ordinary
sand-bag, such as is used to keep the draught from
penetrating between a pair of window-sashes; after
which robbery becomes an easy matter.</p>

<p>Pleasanter it is to turn from the birds of night to
the fops and dandies by day. The word <b>Fop</b> comes
from the German <i>foppen</i>, to make a fool of; and
<b>Dandy</b> from the French <i>dandin</i>, a ninny. Between
these two poor specimens of humanity there is no
perceptible difference. The <b>Macaronies</b> of the last
century derived their designation from the fashionable
“Macaroni Clubs” to which they belonged. The
modern class-title of <b>Masher</b> finds its origin in the
Romany or gipsy word <i>mâsha</i>, signifying “to fascinate
the eye.” <i>En passant</i>, the term <b>Gipsy</b> is a
corruption of <i>Egyptian</i>, so called because the
original family or tribe of low caste Hindoos expelled
by Timour about the year 1399 eventually
travelled into Europe by way of Egypt. The <b>Gipsies</b>
were also in former times known as <b>Bohemians</b>,
from the district in which they first attracted popular
attention before they scattered themselves over
Western Europe. Hence, any individual whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
habits are unconventual, and to a certain extent
nomadic, is styled a <b>Bohemian</b>. The name of
<b>The Upper Ten</b> applied to the aristocracy, is
short for “The Upper Ten Thousand,” a term originally
applied by N. P. Willis, the American poet
(born 1807, died 1867), to the fashionables of New
York who, at the time he introduced it, numbered
about ten thousand. A distinctly latter-day expression
conveying much the same signification is <b>The
Four Hundred</b>, by which we are left to conclude
that the “select” society of New York must have
undergone a considerable weeding-out during the
last twenty years.</p>

<p>The temperance terms <b>Teetotal</b> and <b>Teetotaler</b>
originated in the stuttering exhortation of one
Richard Turner, an artizan of Preston, who, while
addressing a meeting of abstainers in September,
1833, observed that “Nothing but t-t-t-total abstinence
will do!” Several bodies of total abstainers
from alcoholic beverages in England and America
style themselves <b>Rechabites</b>, after the descendants
of Jonadab, the son of Rechab, who lived in tents and
foreswore wine. Others rejoice in the name of
<b>Good Templars</b>, after the Templars of old. The
<b>Good Templar Movement</b> cannot be accurately
described as a <i>crusade</i> against drink; but the
<b>League of the Cross</b>, established by the Roman
Catholics for the total suppression of drunkenness,
is, in title and in fact, one of the most powerful
crusades ever distinguished in modern times.</p>

<p>A sailor is called a <b>Jack Tar</b> because he puts on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
<i>tarpaulin</i> “overalls” in “dirty weather.” <b>Longshoreman</b>
is a corruption of <i>alongshoreman</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, a
wharfinger, &amp;c. <b>Navvy</b> is a contraction of <i>Navigator</i>,
which name was first given to the labourers
employed in the construction of canals for inland
navigation. A cabman is popularly styled a <b>Jehu</b>
in allusion to one of the kings of Israel noted for
his furious driving. A <b>Jerry Builder</b> is so called
after one Jeremiah, a London builder who amassed
a fortune by putting up houses with inferior materials
in order to sell them at a large profit. A <b>Journeyman</b>
is properly one who hires himself out to work
by the day, agreeably to the first portion of the word
<i>Jour</i>, the French for day. A debt-collector is known
as a <b>Dun</b>, and his persistence is styled “Dunning,”
in memory of Joe Dun, a famous bailiff of Lincoln,
who was so successful in the discharge of his duties
that it became quite customary when an individual
refused to pay his debts to exclaim, “Why don’t you
<i>Dun</i> him for it?” which was tantamount to saying,
“Why don’t you send <i>Dun</i> to arrest him?” Whilst
on the subject of law, we may here add that the expression
<b>A Man of Straw</b>, employed to denote a
person without capital or means, originated in the
days when a certain class of men, chiefly ruined
tradesmen, found it a profitable occupation to hire
themselves out as witnesses in the law courts. The
recognized mark of these persons was a wisp of straw
protruding from their shoes; and as often as a lawyer
stood in need of a convenient witness to prove his case,
he knew by the presence of “a pair of straw shoes”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
in court that the owner of the said shoes would
recollect and swear to any incident in consideration
of a fee.</p>

<p><b>Costermonger</b> is a corruption of <i>Costardmonger</i>,
a seller of the famous costard apple introduced into
this country by the Dutch in 1736. Both these terms
are used by Shakespeare; nevertheless, they bore a
totally different signification in his time. The word
<b>Monger</b> comes from the Anglo-Saxon <i>mongere</i>, one
who trades. An itinerant salesman in the olden
time was styled a <b>Pedlar</b>, in accordance with the
Latin <i>pedes</i>, the feet, because he travelled on foot;
whereas <b>Hawker</b> comes from the German <i>hoken</i>, to
carry on the back, to retail. Hawkers and Pedlars
were first licensed in England in 1698. An itinerant
salesman of another kind is known as a <b>Cheap Jack</b>
on account of the word “cheap” which is Saxon for
market, derived from <i>ceapan</i>, to buy. A travelling
medicine-vendor originally received the nickname of
<b>Quack-doctor</b>, or <b>Quack</b>, from <i>Quacksalber</i>, the
German term for quicksilver, because, differing from
the regular practitioners, he resorted to mercury and
other dangerous ingredients. At times a Quack, or
any other individual gifted with humorous colloquial
powers, is dubbed a <b>Merry Andrew</b>, in allusion to
Andrew Borde, a physician of the time of Henry
VIII., noted for his facetious manners and sayings.
<b>Juggler</b> is a corruption of <i>jongleur</i>, the French
designation of one of the companions of the troubadours,
whose business it was to supplement the
lyrical accomplishments of the latter with feats of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
sleight-of-hand and other tricks for the amusement
of the company. A <b>Stump Orator</b> is properly one
who delivers a speech from the stump of a tree; the
literal meaning of a <span class="smcap">Stump Speech</span> being thus
explained.</p>

<p>The now approbrious name of <b>Blackguard</b> was
formerly given to the scullions or dirty dependants of
the English Court who washed out the saucepans,
carried coals up to the kitchens, and performed other
menial duties. As the “Guards of Honour” in the
Royal Household were distinguished by their fine
appearance, so these kitchen-men were equally distinguished
by their grimy appearance; consequently
the latter were styled “Black Guards.” The origin
of the word <b>Scullion</b> was the Norman-French
<i>esculle</i>, a porringer or dish. The place where the
dishes are cleansed is still called a <span class="smcap">Scullery</span>, while
the domestic who performs such work bears the
name of <b>Scullery Maid</b>. A rascal or sharper is
designated a <b>Blackleg</b>, because such a one was
generally to be found among the lower orders of
turf and sporting men at the time these were especially
characterized by the wearing of black top-boots.
A <b>Plunger</b> is one who bets heavily either on
the turf or at the gaming-table, without consideration
for the risks he incurs. A <b>Bookmaker</b> is so
called because he arranges his book, <i>i.e.</i>, his bets, in
such a manner that his losses and gains upon each
day’s racing must balance themselves. The Bookmaker
who absconds after a race in order to avoid
paying those who have entered bets with him and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
won is styled a <b>Welsher</b>, in allusion to the thieving
propensities of a certain race of people, as set forth
in the old song, which begins, “Taffy was a Welshman,
Taffy was a thief,” &amp;c. The word <b>Burglar</b>
is made up of the Old English <i>burgh</i>, a borough,
derived from the German <i>burg</i>, a fortified place, and
the French <i>lair</i>, a thief; the allusion being that such
a one breaks into a private dwelling for purposes of
theft. Down to a comparatively recent date the
common hangman in this country bore the nickname
of <b>Jack Ketch</b>, really a corruption of Richard
Jacquett, to whom the manor of Tyburn, where our
malefactors were executed prior to the year 1783,
belonged.</p>

<p>A native of London is popularly styled a
<b>Cockney</b>, pursuant to the Old English <i>cockeney</i>,
an effeminate person, or rather one who has been
rendered effeminate by the luxuries of the table;
this term tracing its origin directly from the Latin
verb <i>coquere</i>, to cook, whence we have the Italian
<i>cuchina</i>, the French <i>cuisine</i>, the German <i>küche</i>, and
the English <i>kitchen</i>. A popular satiric poem of
the thirteenth century, entitled “The Land of
Cockaygne,”&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, Kitchen Land, draws a picture
of an imaginary Fool’s Paradise, where there is
nothing but eating and drinking, where care, trouble,
and toil find no place&mdash;a desirable country for those
monks of the Church who delight in the pleasures
of the table rather than the observance of their
spiritual exercises. After this performance the term
<b>Cockaigne</b> or <b>Cockaygne</b> gradually came to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
applied to our capital city, where <i>cockenies</i>, or kitchen-servants,
abounded, and where the luxury of good
living was supposed to attain its highest development.</p>

<p>A raw youth, or a countryman new to the ways
of the world, is dubbed a <b>Greenhorn</b>, in reference
to the undeveloped horns of a young ox; the word
“Green” being derived from the Anglo-Saxon <i>grêne</i>,
that which is in process of growing. <b>Nincompoop</b>
is a corruption of the Latin phrase <i>non compos
[mentis]</i>, not in sound mind. A person of defective
mind is called a <b>Lunatic</b>, from the Latin <i>luna</i>, the
moon, in accordance with the Roman idea that the
mind was affected by the changes of the moon. A
person addicted to making foolish mistakes is styled
a <b>Dutchman</b>, in allusion to the dull comprehensions
supposed to be possessed by the inhabitants of the
Low Countries. The term first came into use as an
epithet of derision during the wars with Holland.
A <b>Humbug</b> is one whose representations, though
sounding plausible enough, are not to be relied
upon. The origin of this word is as follows: In
olden times there resided in the neighbourhood of
the Mearns, in Scotland, a gentleman of landed
property whose name was Hume, and whose estate
was known as “The Bogue.” Owing to the great
falsehoods which this “Hume of the Bogue” was
in the habit of relating about himself, his family,
and everything connected with his affairs, it became
customary, as often as the people of that district
heard anything at all remarkable or absurd to exclaim,
“That is a Hume of the Bogue.” The word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
spelt in its present form first appeared on the title-page
of “The Universal Jester: a choice collection
of <i>bonmots</i> and <i>humbugs</i>,” published by Fernando
Killigrew about the year 1736. The assurance that
Humbug is of such old date can scarcely tend to our
satisfaction.</p>

<h2 id="MALT_LIQUORS"><i>MALT LIQUORS.</i></h2>

<p>At the present day the terms <b>Ale</b> and <b>Beer</b>
are used somewhat confusedly. The former,
derived from the Gaelic and Irish <i>ól</i>, drink,
is the real name of our national beverage, which, to
judge from its intoxicating effects, must, in the days
of our forefathers, have been a very strong drink
indeed. The latter, on the other hand, is essentially
a Saxon word, from the same root as <i>barm</i>, signifying
“fermented drink,” and used to denominate the
lighter kinds of fermented liquors generally, as well
as other drinks obtained from the roots or leaves of
plants, such as <span class="smcap">Ginger-beer</span>, <span class="smcap">Spruce-beer</span>, &amp;c. We
still speak of <b>Old Ales</b>; whereas <b>Small Beer</b>
indicates a liquor of very poor quality.</p>

<p>In former times the only varieties of malt liquor
in this country were <b>Ale</b> and <b>Beer</b>, the one strong,
the other comparatively weak. To these a third,
popularly described as <b>Twopenny</b>, was eventually
added. However, it was rare that any one of these
three was demanded singly; it being the custom,
particularly in London, for the working-classes to
call either for <b>Half-and-Half</b> or <b>Three Thirds</b>,
meaning a tankard filled with equal portions of ale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
and beer, or of ale, beer, and twopenny. This
custom remained in vogue until the year 1730,
when it occurred to Mr. Harwood, a brewer of East
London, to prepare a liquor analogous to the mixture
of ale, beer, and twopenny; and thus save the
time of the tavern-keepers, who were compelled to
serve each customer from three different casks.
Almost immediately, therefore, he introduced the
malt liquor known as <b>Entire</b>, because it was drawn
<i>entire</i> from one cask. It was first retailed at the
sign of “The Blue Last,” in Curtain Road, Shoreditch,
where it soon came to be in active demand
by the City porters, who made this house their
regular resort, whereupon the enterprising publican
adroitly called it <b>Porter</b>. The word “Entire” still
appears upon the facia-boards of numerous taverns
throughout the Metropolis; but who thinks of calling
for <i>Entire</i> at the present day? By the term
<b>Stout</b> is implied a malt liquor of the stoutest
quality, <i>i.e.</i>, having the most body in it.</p>

<p><b>Stingo</b> expresses an old beer of particular sharpness,
in allusion to its <i>stinging</i> properties; while
<b>Yorkshire Stingo</b> is, of course, peculiar to the
county of York. Originally the single X displayed
on beer-barrels denoted that the liquor had paid a
ten shillings’ duty. The additional X’s are merely
brewers’ trade-marks, indicating various degrees of
strength over and above that of the single X ale.</p>

<p>Concerning German beers, we need only allude to
<b>Mum</b>, or <b>Mumm</b>, which is peculiar to Brunswick,
and named after Christoph Mumme, who first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
brewed it in 1492; <b>Lager-Bier</b>, so called because it
is kept in a lager or cellar; and <b>Bock-bier</b>, a liquor
which causes the inconsiderate tippler to caper about
like a bock, or goat.</p>

<h2 id="DIAMONDS_AND_PRECIOUS"><i>DIAMONDS AND PRECIOUS
STONES.</i></h2>

<p>The word <b>Diamond</b> is a corruption of, and
synonymous with, <b>Adamant</b>, derived from
the Greek <i>adamas</i>, untamable, infrangible,
not to be subdued, in accordance with the prefix <i>a</i>,
without, and <i>damas</i>, to tame, to subdue. As every
one must be aware, the diamond is capable of resisting
fire.</p>

<p>The great diamonds of the world are the following:&mdash;<b>The
Kohinoor</b>, or “Mountain of Light,” weighing
106 carats, came into the possession of Queen
Victoria on the annexation of the Punjaub in 1849;
the <b>Mattan</b> (367 carats) belongs to the Rajah of
Mattan; the <b>Orloff</b> (194 carats) preserves the family
name of Catherine II. of Russia, who purchased it
in 1775; the <b>Shah</b> (86 carats), presented by Chosroes
I., Shah of Persia, who died in the year 579, to the
Czar of Russia; the <b>Star of the South</b> (254 carats),
discovered in Brazil by a poor negress in 1853; the
<b>Sauci</b> (106 carats), originally the property of a
French gentleman of this name, and bought by the
Russian Czar for half a million roubles in 1835; the
<b>Regent</b>, also known as the <b>Pitt</b> (137 carats), first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
acquired by Mr. Pitt, the grandfather of the Earl
of Chatham, and subsequently sold to the Duc
d’Orleans, Regent of France, for £135,000; the
<b>Pigott</b> (82¼ carats), brought from India by Lord
Pigott sometime previous to 1818, when it came into
the possession of Messrs. Rundell and Bridge; the
<b>Dudley</b> (44½ carats), found at the Cape by a black
shepherd in 1868, and, after various changes of
ownership, bought by the Earl of Dudley for
£30,000; and the <b>Twin Diamonds</b>, both found in
the bed of the river Vaal at the Cape in 1872.</p>

<p>With regard to precious stones:&mdash;the <b>Turquois</b>
derived its name from Turkey, where it was first
found; the <b>Topaz</b>, from Topazos, an island in the
Red Sea; and the <b>Agate</b>, from the Greek <i>Achates</i>, a
river in Sicily, in the bed of which it was anciently
discovered. The term <b>Amethyst</b> comes from the
Greek <i>amethustos</i>, a precious stone, and <b>Opal</b>, through
the Latin <i>opalus</i>, from the Sanskrit <i>opula</i>, a precious
stone. <b>Emerald</b> traces its origin through the
French <i>emerande</i> to the Latin and Greek <i>omaragdus</i>;
<b>Garnet</b>, through the French <i>grenat</i>, from the Latin
<i>granatus</i>; and <b>Ruby</b>, from the Latin <i>ruber</i>, red.
<b>Pearl</b> is an Anglo-Saxon word derived from the
Latin <i>pirula</i>, a diminutive of pear.</p>

<p>We may conveniently add that the weight of
precious stones, as well as that of gold, is regulated
by <b>Carats</b>, because formerly carat seeds, or the seed
of the Abyssinian coral flower were employed for
this purpose.</p>

<h2 id="NAVAL_AND_MILITARY"><i>NAVAL AND MILITARY
SOBRIQUETS.</i></h2>

<p>The Roman Manlius (appointed Consul in the
year 224 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>) received the name of <b>Torquatus</b>
from the incident of having torn the
golden torque or collar from the neck of his adversary
in the field. Charles, the son of Pepin d’Heristal,
was surnamed <b>Martel</b> in recognition of his victory
over the Saracens, who attempted the invasion of
France in the year 732. According to the chronicler,
“he knocked down the foe and crushed them between
his axe, as a martel or hammer crushes what it
strikes.” Robert, Duke of Normandy, the father of
William the Conqueror (died 1035), bore the name
of <b>Robert le Diable</b>, or <b>Robert the Devil</b>, on
account of his courageous cruelty in war. The
Scottish outlaw, Sir William Wallace (born 1270, beheaded
1305), was styled <b>The Hammer and Scourge
of England</b> by reason of his patriotism. William
Douglas, Lord of Nithsdale (died 1390), was known
as <b>Black Douglas</b> because his frame was tall,
strong, and well-built, while his hair was dark and
his complexion swarthy. Archibald Douglas, Earl
of Angus (died 1514), merited the sobriquet of <b>Bell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the Cat</b> for having put to death the upstart favourites
of James III., and so prevented the creation of
nobles out of architects and masons whom the king
particularly patronized. At a meeting convened in
the Church of Lauder by the Scottish nobles for the
purpose of taking measures to obtain the removal
of these persons, Lord Gray had put the question,
“But who will bell the cat?” “That will I!”
answered Douglas on the instant; and he kept his
word, for in the very presence of the king he slew
the obnoxious minions with his own hand.</p>

<p>Richard Nevil, Earl of Warwick (born 1420, died
1471), was surnamed <b>The King Maker</b> for the
reason that while he espoused the cause of the
Yorkists, Edward IV. succeeded in his efforts to gain
the English Crown; and when, subsequently, he
transferred his influence to the Lancastrians, Henry
VI. was restored and the usurper deposed. Harry
Percy (born 1364, died 1403) was styled <b>Hotspur</b>,
and Prince Rupert (born 1619, died 1682) <b>The Mad
Cavalier</b> because they found it impossible to
restrain their rash courage in time of war. The
soldiers of Cromwell, after the Battle of Marston
Moor, received the popular name of <b>Ironsides</b> on
account of their armour and their iron resolution.
The sobriquet of <b>The Almighty Nose</b> was bestowed
upon Oliver Cromwell (born 1599, died 1658), in
allusion to his nasal enormity. Strange, indeed,
that he who had attained to the highest position in
the land by the sheer force of arms should have been
so continually taunted with the length and colour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
his nose! Yet so it was. Nevertheless, there have
been others whose peace of mind was daily threatened
by popular malice in this selfsame respect. Even
the great Roman poet Ovid suffered a lifelong
martyrdom, and became the recipient of the sobriquet
of <b>Naso</b>, owing to the possession of an unusually
large nose; just as in modern times Wilson, the
painter, and Cervetto, the violincellist of Drury Lane
Theatre, never succeeded in putting their heads out
of their own doors without being greeted with shouts
of “<b>Nosey!</b>” from the mob.</p>

<p>The Duke of Cumberland (born 1721, died 1765)
rightly deserved the opprobrious surname of <b>The
Bloody Butcher</b> on account of his merciless
slaughter of the vanquished adherents of the Young
Pretender after the Battle of Culloden. The soldiers
of the Duke of Marlborough (born 1650, died 1722)
familiarly styled their leader <b>Corporal John</b> because
he had risen from the rank of Corporal; while
General Bonaparte, afterwards Emperor of the
French (born 1769, died 1821), bore the name of
<b>The Little Corporal</b>, in allusion to his original
rank, his low stature, youthful appearance, and
extraordinary courage. As most readers are aware,
Wellington (born 1769, died 1852) earned the name
of <b>The Iron Duke</b> by his iron will and resolution;
and Blucher (born 1742, died 1819) that of <b>Marshal
Forward</b>, by his dash and readiness to attack the
enemy in the campaign which terminated in the
Battle of Waterloo. Prince Bismarck, the late
Chancellor of the German Empire (born 1815) owed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
his surname of <b>The Iron Chancellor</b> to his extraordinary
vigour and indomitable will. Helmuth,
Count von Moltke, Field-Marshal of the German
armies (born 1800, died 1891), was popularly surnamed
<b>Helmuth the Taciturn</b>, because though a master
of half a dozen languages, he was never known to
betray himself in one of them. The sobriquet
of <b>Stonewall Jackson</b>, possessed by Thomas
Jonathan Jackson, the Confederate General in the
American War of 1861 to 1865, originated with
General Lee, who, after rallying his troops at the
Battle of Bull Run, exclaimed, “There is Jackson,
standing like a stone wall!” A less complimentary
sobriquet bestowed upon General Andrew Jackson,
President of the United States (born 1767, died
1845), by his own soldiers, was that of <b>Old
Hickory</b>, in allusion to his tough, unyielding disposition.
The circumstance is thus commented
upon by Parton, the author of Jackson’s Life:&mdash;“The
name of <i>Old Hickory</i> was not an instantaneous
inspiration, but a growth. First of all, the remark
was made by some soldier, who was struck with his
commander’s pedestrian powers, that the General
was tough. Next, it was observed that he was as
tough as hickory. Then he was called <i>Hickory</i>.
Lastly, the affectionate adjective ‘old’ was prefixed,
and the General thenceforth rejoiced in the
completed nickname, usually the first-won honour
of a great commander.”</p>

<p>Of naval sobriquets we shall mention only three.
Commodore John Byron, the circumnavigator (born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
1723, died 1786), was popularly known as <b>Foul
Weather Jack</b> because, it was said, he never
enjoyed a fine passage throughout the whole of his
experience. Admiral Edward Vernon (born 1684,
died 1757), to whom reference is made in our article
on “<a href="#MALT_LIQUORS">Spirits</a>,” was called <b>Old Grog</b>, because he wore
a “Grogram” coat in “dirty weather” [<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_178"><span class="smcap">Grogram</span></a>].
Admiral Sir Henry Digby received his well-known
sobriquet of <b>The Silver Captain</b> under the following
interesting circumstances:&mdash;On the October 14,
1799, when commanding the frigate <i>Alcmene</i>, on a
cruise off the Spanish coast, he shaped his course
for Cape St. Vincent, and was running to the southward,
in the latitude of Cape Finisterre. Twice
during the night he rang his bell to summon the
officer on the watch, and asked him if any person
had been in the cabin. “No, sir; nobody,” was the
answer. “Very odd,” rejoined Sir Henry. “Every
time I dropped asleep I heard somebody shouting in
my ear, ‘Digby! Digby! go to the northward;
Digby! Digby! go to the northward!’ I shall certainly
do so. Take another reef in your topsails,
haul your wind, tack every hour till daybreak, and
then call me.” These orders were strictly carried
out, and the frigate was tacked at four, at five, at six,
and at seven o’clock. She had just come round for
the last time when the man at the masthead called
out, “Large ship on the weather-bow, sir!” On
nearing her a musket was discharged to bring her to.
She was quickly boarded, when she proved to be a
Spanish vessel laden with dollars, in addition to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
large cargo of cochineal and spices. By this
capture therefore, the fortunate dreamer secured, as
his (Captain’s) share of the prize-money, the sum of
£40,730 18s.; the lieutenants each £5,091 7s. 3d.;
the warrant officers each £2,468 10s. 9½d.; the midshipmen
each £791 17s. 0¼d.; and the seamen and
marines each £182 14s. 9½d. The captured treasure
was said to have been so weighty that sixty-three
artillery tumbrils had to be requisitioned for the purpose
of transporting it from the vessel to Plymouth
Citadel.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="MONEY"><i>MONEY.</i></h2>

<p>The word <b>Money</b> owes its existence to
<i>Moneta</i>, one of the surnames of Juno, in
whose temple the first coinage of the Romans
took place. <b>Mint</b> claims the same etymology, being
a contraction of the Latin <i>moneta</i>, brought about
through the Anglo-Saxon <i>mynet</i>. By <b>Sterling
Money</b> is meant the standard coin of Great Britain,
and for this reason:&mdash;During the reign of King John
the merchants of the Hansa Towns, of which the
inhabitants were commonly described as Esterlings,
because they resided in the eastern portions of
Germany, having long been noted for the purity of
their coinage, the king invited a number of them
over to this country for the purpose of reforming
and perfecting our coinage. The invitation was
accepted; and ever afterwards good English money
received the name of Esterling or sterling money.</p>

<p>A <b>Guinea</b> was an English gold piece first struck
in 1663 out of gold brought from the coast of Guinea,
West Africa. Its value has been subject to fluctuations
at different periods. Thus, in 1663 it was
worth 20s.; in 1695, 30s.; in 1717, 21s.; in 1810,
22s. 6d.; and in 1816, 26s. The coinage of guineas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
was discontinued July 1, 1817. A <b>Sovereign</b> is so
called because when originally coined, during the
reign of Henry VIII., it bore a representation of
that sovereign in his royal robes. A <b>Crown-piece</b>
when first introduced displayed a crown on its reverse
side. The <b>Florin</b> took its name from Florence, in
which city it was struck as long ago as the thirteenth
century. Its reverse side has always borne a representation
of a lily, emblematical of “The City of
Flowers.” The term <b>Shilling</b> traces its origin in the
Anglo-Saxon <i>scilling</i>, the Icelandic <i>skillinge</i>, and the
Gothic <i>skilliggs</i>, in each case denoting the twentieth
part of a pound, as at present. A <b>Penny</b>, so called
from the Anglo-Saxon <i>penig</i>, and Danish <i>pennig</i>
(whence the modern German <b>Pfennig</b> has been
derived), originally denoted a copper coin of full
value; a <b>Halfpenny</b>, the half of a penny; and a
<b>Farthing</b>, a corruption of the Old English <i>fourthling</i>,
denotes a penny divided into four parts. We must
not omit to mention that in olden times only penny-pieces
were struck; and these were deeply indented
in the form of a cross&mdash;exactly, in fact, after the
manner of our Good Friday buns; so that when half-pennies
or farthings were required the pennies could
be broken into two or four portions without
difficulty.</p>

<p>Among coins other than those now current in this
country we may mention the <b>Ducat</b>, or Duke’s
Money, specially struck for circulation in the Duchy
of Apulia in the year 1140, and which bore this
beautiful inscription: “Sit tibi Christi, datus, quem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
tu regis, iste ducatus” (“May this duchy which
You rule be devoted to You, O Christ”); and the
<b>Noble</b>, so called on account of the superiority of its
gold. During the reign of Henry III. this gold piece
found its way into England under the name of <b>Rose-Noble</b>,
owing to the impression of a rose on its
reverse side; but in the reign of Henry VIII.,
simultaneous with the substitution of the figure of
St. George, it was designated a <b>George-Noble</b>.
The value of this coin at both periods was six-and-eightpence.
The current value of an <b>Angel</b>, so
styled from the angel on its reverse side, was, when
introduced in the reign of Henry VI., six-and-eightpence;
but at the accession of Elizabeth it had
increased to ten shillings.</p>

<p>The <b>Thistle-crown</b> of James VI. of Scotland
(James I. of England), value four shillings, was so
called because it had a rose on one side and a thistle
on the other; both surmounted by a crown. The
Scottish sovereign of this period was styled a
<b>Jacobus</b>, the Latinized form of the King’s name.
After the union of the two countries it became, of
course, current in England also; but in the two succeeding
reigns it was denominated a <b>Carolus</b>, the
Latin for the name of Charles. A French gold
coin long current in Scotland was the <b>Dolphin</b>,
which derived its name from the fact of its introduction
by Charles V., who was also Dauphin of
Vienne. The French <b>Louis d’or</b> (a louis of gold)
was first struck in the reign of Louis XIII.;
this was superseded by the <b>Napoleon</b>, during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
consulate of Napoleon Bonaparte. The <b>Franc</b>
originally denoted the silver coin of the Franks.
The term <b>Dollar</b> is a British modification of the
German Thaler, an abbreviation of Joachim’s-Thaler;
by which was implied a piece of money
struck out of the silver discovered in the Thal, or
Valley, of St. Joachim, France, about the year 1518.
The silver drawn from this valley being of superior
quality, it was coined into ounce pieces, which
received the name of <b>Joachims-Thalers</b>; but all
other ounce pieces subsequently struck from silver
obtained elsewhere were simply called <b>Thalers</b>.
The <b>Kreuzer</b>, now superseded, owed its name to the
cross on its reverse side.</p>

<p><b>Wood’s Halfpence</b> was the designation of an
inferior copper coinage circulated in Ireland by a
certain William Wood, under a patent granted to
him by George I. The withdrawal of the patent
was eventually procured owing to the denunciations
of Dean Swift in the mysterious “Drapier’s Letters.”
The legal tender notes of the United States are
commonly styled <b>Greenbacks</b>, from the colour of
the device imprinted on the back of them. Bank of
England notes formerly bore the name of <b>Abraham
Newlands</b> from the signature of the chief cashier.</p>

<p>By the term <b>Bullion</b>, remotely derived from the
Low Latin <i>bulla</i>, a seal, and, more directly, from the
Old French <i>bullione</i>, the Mint, is meant the stock of
the precious metals formed into bars and stored in the
strong rooms of the Bank of England in readiness for
coinage. Money vested in Government securities is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
known as <b>Stock</b>, or <b>Government Stock</b>, in allusion
to the origin of the term, viz., the Anglo-Saxon
stocc, a trunk, a stick; because prior to the year 1782,
when the practice was abolished, the official acknowledgment
of money received on behalf of the Government
was written on both sides of a broad piece of
wood, which was then cut in two; and the one portion,
called the Stock, was delivered to the person
lending the money, the Counterstock being retained
at the Tally Office. The instrument of reckoning
in this manner was styled the <b>Tally</b>, in accordance
with the French verb <i>tailler</i>, to cut; while the correspondence
of the Stock and Counterstock, or, in
other words, the two portions of the Tally, furnished
the origin of the modern phrase “to tally,” as well
as the designation <span class="smcap">Tallyman</span>, or a trader who lets
out goods, principally clothing, on the system of payment
by weekly instalments. The word <b>Consols</b> is
a contraction of “Consolidated Annuities,” or the
funded portion of the National Debt. The fund
which provides for the annual reduction of the latter
is styled the <b>Sinking Fund</b>. The French State
Loans known as <b>Tontines</b> perpetuate the name of
Lawrence Tonti, a Neapolitan <i>protégé</i> of Cardinal
Mazarine, who projected the scheme in 1653. The
annual statement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer
of the finances of this country is called the <b>Budget</b>,
agreeably to the French <i>bougetta</i>, a little bag; because
formerly the various documents were presented to
Parliament in a leathern bag.</p>

<p><b>Rum</b> is a native West Indian term for a spirit
distilled from cane-juice; <b>Whisky</b> is an
English rendering of the Irish <b>Uisquebaugh</b>,
derived from the two Gaelic words <i>uisge</i>,
water, and <i>beatha</i>, life; <b>Brandy</b> is a corruption of
the Old English <i>brandwine</i>, literally burnt wine;
while <b>Gin</b> is short for Geneva, where this spirit was
first distilled. <b>Hollands</b> is the popular English
name for Dutch gin. <b>Cognac</b>, a French brandy of

of which it forms the staple industry; and <b>Nantes</b>
to the port where it is shipped. <b>Old Tom</b> was
named after Tom Chamberlain, the senior partner
in Messrs. Hodges’ well-known distillery.</p>

<p>The term <b>Punch</b> traces its origin to the Hindoo
<i>pantsch</i>, signifying five, because this favourite concoction
originally consisted of five ingredients, viz.,
arrack, sugar, tea, lemons, and water; whereas
<b>Toddy</b> is a western corruption of <i>taudi</i>, the native
Hindoo name for palm-juice. The word <b>Grog</b>
perpetuates the memory of “Old Grog,” the nickname
of Admiral Edward Vernon, who first ordered
his sailors to dilute their rum with water [<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_250"><span class="smcap">Old
Grog</span></a>].</p>

<p>Scotch whisky is usually styled <b>Mountain Dew</b>,
from the fact that in former times it was often distilled
in the mountains in order to escape the watchfulness
of the excise officers. The superior Scotch
whisky known as <b>Glenlivet</b> derives its name from
the district in which it is distilled. The popular
<b>LL Whisky</b> originated under the following circumstances:
When the Duke of Richmond was
Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, he one day, in the year
1807, sent to various Dublin distilleries for samples
of their best whisky; and preferring that furnished
by Messrs. Kinahan, his Grace ordered a large vat
in which this particular quality of the spirit was
kept to be reserved for his own use. Accordingly, the
letters “LL,” signifying Lord Lieutenant, were
painted on the vat; and ever since Messrs. Kinahan’s
whisky of the same quality has borne the
name of “LL Whisky.”</p>

<p><b>Fleet Street</b> received its name from the
<b>Fleet</b>, once a swift-flowing stream, now
converted into a sewer. <b>Mitre Court</b>,
<b>Falcon Court</b>, and <b>Red Lion Court</b> were designated
after old taverns respectively bearing these
signs. <b>Bolt Court</b> was so called from the “Bolt-in-Tun,”
an ancient coaching-house, transformed
into a railway goods receiving office standing on the
opposite side of the way. <b>Johnson’s Court</b> did
not receive its title from Dr. Johnson, who lived in
it for some time, but from the owner of the property.
<b>Wine Office Court</b> originally contained an office
where wine licences were issued. <b>Shoe Lane</b> received
this designation from the traditional account
that when the Devil ran away with Lady Hatton
[<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_270"><span class="smcap">Hatton Garden</span></a>] he dropped one of her shoes
in Shoe Lane and her cloak in <b>Cloak Lane</b>,
near Cannon Street. <b>St. Bride Street</b> and <b>Bride
Lane</b> owe their names to the Church of St.
Bride close by. <b>Salisbury Court</b> occupies the
site of an ancient palace of the Bishops of Salisbury.

carry us back in fancy to the <b>Dorset Gardens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Theatre</b>, erected in the grounds attached to the
residence of the Earl of Dorset in the early days of
the Restoration. <b>Whitefriars Street</b> marks the
western boundary of the monastery of the Carmelites,
or White Friars, built in 1245. The whole
district of Whitefriars formerly comprised a Sanctuary
infested by debtors and lawbreakers; on which
account it bore the name of <b>Alsatia</b>, in allusion to
the French province of Alsace, long notorious for its
intestine strife and political disaffection. <b>Bridge
Street</b> is a modern thoroughfare leading to <b>Blackfriars
Bridge</b> and <b>Blackfriars Road</b>, so called
from the monastery of the Dominicans or Black

Yard</b> was formerly the coachyard of the celebrated
Inn of this name. <b>The Old Bailey</b> is a corruption
of <i>Bail Hill</i>, which contained the residence and court

were so narrow that opposite neighbours could shake
hands out of their top-story windows. <b>Friar
Street</b> was designated after the Black Friars’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>

Chain</b> owed its name to a chain formerly drawn
across its northern extremity the while service was
held in St. Paul’s. <b>Old Change</b> was originally
known as “The King’s Exchange” on account of the
building where the bullion was stored convenient to
the Money-shearers’ Office and the Mint. <b>Paternoster
Row</b> received its name from the stationers
who sold religious texts, prayer-books, and rosary
beads, formerly called <i>Paternosters</i> in this street.

the Church of St. Lawrence in <b>Gresham Street</b>,
which perpetuates the memory of Sir Thomas
Gresham, merchant and founder of the Royal
Exchange (born 1519, died 1579), because <b>Gresham
College</b>, established by him in his own mansion,
on the site of the present <b>Gresham House</b>, Old
Broad Street, was removed here in 1843. <b>Lad Lane</b>,
now absorbed in Gresham Street, was a corruption
of “Our Lady Lane,” so called from a
statue of the Virgin. <b>Aldermanbury</b> was so

the Thames. <b>Crooked Lane</b> was so called from its
winding character. <b>Swan Alley</b>, in Upper Thames
Street, derived its title from an ancient mansion of
the Beauchamps whose crest was a swan. <b>Boss
Alley</b> calls attention to the fact that the executors
of Sir Richard Whittington erected a <i>boss</i>, or conduit,
hereabouts in the long, long ago. <b>College
Hill</b> is all that remains to remind us of the College
of St. Spirit and St. Mary founded on its site by the
same generous Lord Mayor and benefactor of the
public. <b>Fye Foot Lane</b> is properly “five-foot
lane,” the actual width of this thoroughfare at one
end; while <b>Duck’s Foot Lane</b> is a corruption of
“Duke’s Foot Lane,” signifying the private path
leading from the manor-house of the Dukes of

thoroughfare anciently graced (or disgraced) by a

William Farrindon, citizen and goldsmith, who purchased
the Aldermanry of the Ward still known by

of the grounds attached to Ely House, the
London residence of the Bishops of Ely, which
stood on the spot now marked by <b>Ely Place</b>, and
bounded on the west by <b>Hatton Garden</b>; so called
because, when the property became demised to the
Crown, it was presented by Queen Elizabeth to Sir
Christopher Hatton, who literally danced himself
into Her Majesty’s favour. <b>Snow Hill</b> was formerly
described as “Snore Hill,” from the fact that the
stage-coach passengers intended for “The Saracen’s
Head” were generally fast asleep when they arrived
at their destination.</p>

indicative of a stream in a hollow. In Domesday

the Cursitors’ Office founded in this vicinity by the
father of the great Lord Bacon. The Cursitors were

Chapel</b>, the oldest Roman Catholic chapel in
London, dating back to the year 1648, and originally
the residence of the Sardinian ambassador. <b>Great
Turnstile</b> and <b>Little Turnstile</b> are pleasant-sounding
names, eminently suggestive of the rural
character of this neighbourhood in bygone days.
The turnstiles were set up to prevent sheep and
cattle from straying out of Lincoln’s Inn Fields into
the public highway. <b>Great Queen Street</b> was so
called in compliment to Queen Elizabeth, in whose
reign it was first formed into a footway for pedestrians
plodding westwards from Lincoln’s Inn towards

times as <i>Aldwyche</i>, denoting the road leading directly
from the Strand and the church just mentioned to
the “Old town,” now known as Broad Street, St.
Giles’s parish. <b>Holywell Street</b> took its title from
the Holy Well discovered on the eastern side of St.
Clement-Danes.</p>

partially bestowed upon the Duke of Wellington by
the designation of <b>Waterloo Bridge</b>, opened June

<b>Bow Street</b> was so called on account of its bent
shape when it was first laid out to connect the

Albemarle. In bygone times the whole of Clerkenwell
received the opprobrious title of <b>Hockley-in-the-Hole</b>,
the name of a place in Bedfordshire
noted far and wide for its impassable and sloughy
character. <b>Hockley</b> is an Anglo-Saxon term, denoting
a muddy field. <b>Myddleton Square</b> and
<b>Myddleton Street</b> perpetuate the memory of Sir
Hugh Myddleton, the founder of the New River
Waterworks, opened September 16, 1613. <b>Pentonville
Road</b> owes its title to the <i>ville</i>, or rural mansion,
occupied by Henry Penton, Esq., Lord of the
Admiralty and M.P. for Winchester, on the spot
where <b>Penton Street</b> now stands. Mr. Penton died
in 1812. <b>St. John Street Road</b> took its name from

by order of the Lord Protector Somerset, in 1549.
<b>City Road</b> was the regular highway from the City
to the “Angel” at Islington, and thence to the north

Walk</b> was originally a pleasant path
leading through the open fields direct from Finsbury
to St. Mary’s parish church, Islington. <b>Golden
Lane</b>, St. Luke’s, received its name from the number
of goldsmiths who formerly made this neighbourhood
their residence. In <b>Curtain Road</b>, Shoreditch,
stood the Curtain Theatre, opened in 1571,
so called because it was the first playhouse to make
use of a drop-curtain. Ben Jonson’s “Every Man
in his Humour” was produced here in 1596. By
<b>Norton Folgate</b> is meant “the northern Falgate,”
the latter word being the old English description of
a four-barred gate. <span class="smcap">The Falgate</span> is a common

<p><b>Seven Sisters’ Road</b>, Holloway, received its
name from seven trees, said to have been planted
by seven sisters, near Tottenham, six of which grew
erect; but the seventh presented a deformed appearance,
because the sister who had planted it was a
cripple. <b>Archway Road</b>, Highgate, is spanned by
the wonderful high arch completed in 1813. <b>Flask
Walk</b>, Hampstead, derived its name from “The
Flask,” a picturesque old inn close by. <b>Judges’
Walk</b>, known also as <b>King’s Bench Avenue</b>,
was originally so called from a colony of judges and
gownsmen of the City, who sought refuge here in
tents during the Great Plague in 1665. <b>Fleet
Road</b>, Haverstock Hill, affords us a pleasing remembrance
of that little river, the Fleet, meandering

behind the older houses, on its way towards
Battle Bridge, the City, and the Thames. <b>Dale
Road</b> preserves the memory of Canon Dale, poet,
and vicar of St. Pancras. <b>Barrow Road</b> and

built <b>Hicks’ Hall</b>, Clerkenwell, in 1612, afterwards
created Viscount Campden. <b>Warwick Road</b>,

their names from Sir Thomas Grosvenor, the
ancestor of the Duke of Westminster, the ground
landlord of the district collectively known as Belgravia;
<b>Eccleston Street</b> and <b>Eccleston Square</b>
from Eccleston, in Cheshire, the county in which

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
